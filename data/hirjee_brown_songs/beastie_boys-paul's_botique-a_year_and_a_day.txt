[Verse One]
Emcee for what I am, and do
The A is for Adam, and the lyrics... true
So as pray and hope, that the message is sent
And I am living in the dreams that I have dreamt
Because I'm down with the three, the unstoppable three
Me and Adam and D were born, to emcee
And my body and soul and mind are pure
Not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
Just lyrics from I to you recited
Arrested, bailed but cuffed, and indicted
Enter the arena as I take the center stage
The lights set low and the night has come of age
The microphone in hand and I am a professional
Speak my knowledge to the crowd and the +Ed+ is +Special+
For I am the +Bard+ and I am +The Last+ one
I am the king and this is my castle
Dwell in realms of now but lve in those of the past
Seen a glimpse from ahead and I don't think it's gonna last
And you can bet your ass

[Verse Two]
I drop the L when I'm skiin, I'm smokin and peakin
I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
Can't stop my mindfuck when it's rollin along
Can't stop the smooth running when the shit's runnin strong
Broke my bindings, the lion with wings
Preaching his word and the b-boy sing
I am one with myself, as I turn to me
Prefer the dreams to the reality
I prefer my life don't need no other man's wife
Don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
But it's good to havethe  turn to be a king for a day
Or for a week or for a year or for a year in a day
Come what may...

[Verse Three]
I'm fishin in my boat and I'm fishing for trout
Mix the Bass Ale with the Guinness Stout
Fishing for a line inside my brain
And lookin out at the world through my window pane
Every day has many colors cause the glass is stained
Everything has changed but remains the same
So once again the mirror raised
And I see myself as clear as day
And I am goin to the limits of my ultimate destiny
Feeling as though somebody somewhere is testin me
He who sees the end from the beginning of time
Looking forward through all the ages
Is, was, and always shall be
Check the prophetic sections of the pages...
He goes by the name of Disco Dave
