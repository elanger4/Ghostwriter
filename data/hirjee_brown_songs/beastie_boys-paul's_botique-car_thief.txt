[Verse One]
Some static started - in the pool hall
Hit a motherfucker's face - with the cue ball
Then I met this girl - she tried to gank me
So I smacked her in the booty with a plank B
Cause me and my crew are out breakin windows
The bingo, the lotto, you know I'll never win those
Possession is half the law
I had my routines before all y'all
Your whole life is comin apart at the seams
You ain't nothin but a car thief bitin routines
See I'm a city slicker - I, I ain't no townie
Right now I wish I had another hash brownie
And like Rickie always said you've got to toke and pass
Or Mookie's gonna kick your motherfuckin ass
Try to take what isn't yours like a God damn rat
See, I personally, I wouldn't want to go out like that

[Verse Two]
I'm a writer - a poet - a genius - I know it
I don't buy cheeba, I grow it (marijuana)
People always trying to get next to me
I had a beautiful experience on ecstasy
I smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer
Because I had to deal with a money hungry miser
Had a 'caine filled Kool with my man Rush Rush
Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush
You be doin nose candy on the Bowie coke mirror
My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her
You can't deny me, you always want to try me
Yo, you're just gonna get your ass kicked
Homeboy, throw in the towel
Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell
The Godfather of Soul in the belly of the beast
Smokin that dust at St. Anthony's Feast

[Verse Three]
All the wifebeaters, and all the tax cheaters
Sitting in the White House pullig their peters
Buy my cheeba - from the cop down the street
The only cop with a rrrope chain when he's walkin the beat
So like a sneaky pouch time bomb tickin
A-like the beat to my rhyme just kickin
Space cake cookies, I discover who I am
I'm a dusted old bummy Hurdy Gurdy Man
Five-oh caught me now I'm going to the mountains
Said good-bye to my girl, my lawyers and accountants
My mind is kinda rhymin and I think I oughta think
So I'm rockin all the rhymes, and I'll have another drink
So the lights are flashin, my mind is spinning
I feel like it is always the beginning - of another
Ryme I'm rapping, emceeing I rock
You ain't nothin but a car thief who must be stopped
