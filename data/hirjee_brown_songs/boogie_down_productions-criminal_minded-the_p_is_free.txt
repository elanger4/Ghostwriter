Song:   The P is Free

Yes, Scott LaRock you know you rule hip-hop
Yes, Mr. Lee you can rule hip-hop
And, B-57 you can rule hip-hop
But, KRS-One rule it non-stop
When I'm in Brooklyn, yes, we rulin hip-hop
When I'm in Manhattan, we rulin hip-hop
When I'm in Queens, we rulin hip-hop
And when in Staten Island we rulin hip-hop
But in the Bronx, we rulin y'all tonight
But in the Bronx, we rulin y'all tonight
We come to rock you whether you're Black or you're white
Cos KRS-One you know I'm never ?frank?
Come catch a star

The girlies are free
Cos the crack costs money
Oh yeah
I say the girlies are free
Cos the crack costs money
Oh yeah

Ridin one day on my freestyle fix
Jammin to a tape Scott LaRock had mixed
I said to myself "This tape sound funky"
Ridin past the 116th Street junkie
Thought I saw Denise but I was only assumin
Took another look and that butt was boomin
Did a little trick on my freestyle fix
And I was right beside the girl, she was all on the tip
She said "Hi, DJ KRS"
She kissed me on my neck so I gave her a peck
She said "I'm really in a hurry so I cannot wait
If you give me a life while we ride to the ?bait?"
She jumped on my bike, I said "Huh, what's your stop?"
She said "Right around the corner to the crack spot
If you buy me a crack I'll know how to act
But if you don't, you might as well step back"
I said "Now how the hell we jump off to this?
I'm doin you a favor, I'm givin you a lift"
She said "KRS, you know it goes"
I said "Yeah, you little.....it seems that you're a hoe"
I did a little trick on my freestyle fix
And she was right on the ground lookin after it
Because...

A girl tried to take my out one day
For a play, not your everyday ?trey?
We walked to the spot, she says she want a rock
I looked in my pocket, didn't have a lot
I said "You better get yourself a job"
She tried to tell me that times were hard
I told the hoe, I said "Yo, that's not my fault
You need a vault", I'm out to assault
Any girl I find who try to take my for mine
I'm gonna have to ?pin? it just another time
But...
