(Intro, DMX)
Sometimes....
Sometimes you just know
You just know, that's all

(Hook)
I can feel it
Coming in the air tonight, hold onnnn
I've been waiting for this moment
For all my life, hold ooonnn
Hold oooooonnnnnn

(Verse 1)
The best of y'all niggas, remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped a nigga from goin under
And you wonder... why I pat you on your head and smile?
Look in your eyes and thank The Lord for my child
Meanwhile, there's somethin' I gotta show you, and I hope you can take it
Gotta leave you in the desert, and I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass, to see what it does to you
When you stand up, you'll see that I'm just showin love to you
Other niggas'll put a slug through you, over your 'ends
Cats I fuck with are real; But hey, those are your friends
It's just what you got comin
Sometimes you dont know what you asking for, yet you ask for more
Shut the casket door
This one here, it is done
They thought you was a killa
You swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It's coming in the air
Yeah, it's getting closer

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I can take that and hit 'em with the blazin tracks
When I make that, you fake cats have violent dreams
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The devil got a hold on me, and he won't let go
I can feel The Lord pullin, but he movin dead slow
Let 'em know, that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winning, but...
We all do the losing, it's just who does the choosing
Is you goin up or down?
What have you been provin? Just that you a fuckin clown
Been seein' through the bullshit, but never spoke on it
Cause I know that deep down, you really don't want it
I would've traded the chance of being the child with a father
For a talent and being able to survive when it's harder
My balance in the high beams of life keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin streets tonight, come on!

(Hook)

(Verse 3)
There's a lotta shit that I let slide, cause It's not in my hands
Lotta niggas I let ride, but it's not in my plans
And a lotta my mans, is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truck-loads... fleeing to the morgue
Full moon! (Aahoooooo) The howlin!
(Grrrrrrrr) The growlin!
(Shhhhhhhh) The prowlin!
Don't know love? Can't show love!
That means you gon' need more love than a old thug
But hold up... roll up
Talkin out the side of your mouth..!
Is what's gon' let niggas know what you got in your house
While they lyin' to your spouse; Told her it was suicide
But you and I, both know the truth; It will never die
Listen nigga; If you scared, get a dog
But be prepared for the morgue
Because you DEAD up in the fog
And that's your head, by the log
I can smell it in the air...
I can tell when it's there...
This is hell and we're both here!
Can you feel it? Tell me yeah!

(Hook)
