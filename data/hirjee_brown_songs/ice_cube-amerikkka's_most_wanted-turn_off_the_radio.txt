Turn on the radio take a listen
What you're missing
Personally I'm sick of the ass-kissing
What I'm kicking to you won't get rotation
Nowhere in the nation
Program directors and DJ's ignored me
Cause I simply said fuck Top Forty
And top thirty top twenty and top ten
Until you put more hip-hop in
Then I might grin but don't pretend that you're down with the C
And go and dis me in a magazine
How could you figure the brother could dig ya
DJ face down in the river
No it's not a threat but a promise
I'm as 
Crazy as they come see 
Mama didn't love me
All I got is my nine
And to calm the savage beast here's the Alpine



Tune in to the radio listen for a minute
Yo G stick a fucking tape in it
Cause all the radio do is gangle
That R&B love triangle
If you're out there kicking it with the brothers
You don't care about lovers
You wanna hear a young nigga on the mic
Going buck wild
Throwing and flowing and showing new styles
That's where I'm coming from
Reality that's what they're running from
So if you're down with Ice Cube let me know that you know
Yo turn off the radio
