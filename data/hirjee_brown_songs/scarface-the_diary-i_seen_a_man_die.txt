[Intro: Scarface + friend]
     So what you gonna do cat daddy?
[Face] I don't know dawg... just trying to live it one day at a time
     I hear you man, live it one day at a time...
[Face] Let me get up outta here man my ride waitin
     Aight cat daddy stay true
[Face] Aight man peace

[Verse 1: Scarface]
He greets his father with his hands out
Rehabilitated slightly, glad to be the man's child
The world is different since he's seen it last
Out of jail been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
All he had was his mother left
Now she's gone and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better
But he's black so he's got one strike against him
And he's young plus he came up in the system
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen
And his goal is to get on top and try to stay clean
So he's calling up his homie who done came up
Livin' large, now they dealin' with the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth it
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
Now it's different, he who did dirt
And realized killin' men, meant comin' up but it still hurt
And can't nobody change this
It's nineteen-ninety-four and we up against the same shit

[Chorus: Scarface]
I never understand why
I could never seen a man cry, til I seen that man die

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Imagine life at it's full peak
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy
Imagine peace on this earth when there's no grief
Imagine grief on this earth when there's no peace
Everybody's got a different way of endin' it
And when your number comes for service then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for the final test
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath
How much longer will it be til it's all done?
Total darkness and ease be at all one
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate
You took his life, but his memory you'll never take
You'll be headed to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Scarface]
I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you kinda scared to die and so you hold on
And you keep on blacking out cause and your pulse is low
Stop trying to fight the reaper just relax and let it go
Because there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try
And you can try it til you fight it but you'll still die
Now your spirit leaves your body and your mind clears
The rigormortis starts to set, now you outta here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal light
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life
Make the choice let it go but you can back it up
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up
But if you ready close your eyes and we can set it free
There lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace

[Chorus]
