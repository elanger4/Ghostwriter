[Verse One]
It's four AM, I've got the Hasenpfeffer Ale
I've got nothin to lose and so I'm pissin on the third rail
Groggy eyed and fried and I'm headed for the station
D0train ride to Coney Island vacation
This one's, dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1-train
They be kickin out windows high on cocaine
Then I jump the turnstile, I lost my last token
Right between the cars, pissin, smokin
Head for the last car, fluorescent light blackout
Policeman told my homeboy - yo put that crack out
You know you light up when the lights go down
And then you read the New York Post, Fulton St. downtown
Same faces every day but you don't know their names
Party people going places on the D-train

{Stop that train, I wanna get off...}

[Verse Two]
Check it! Trench coat, wingtip, going to work
And you'll be pullin a train like you're Captain Kirk
Pick pocket gangsters payin their debts
I caught a bullet in the lung from Bernie Goetz
Overworked and underpaid, starin at the floor
Prostitutes spandex caught in the slide doors
Now stuck between the stations it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
$50.00 fine for disturbing the peace
The neck, tortoise, your Lees are creased
Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin
Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin
Elevated platform, I'm never gonna conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes
over the loudspeaker about the hard times
Sat across from a man readin El Diario
Riding the train down from the El Barrio
Went from the station, to Orange Julius
I bought a hot dog - from WHO? George Drakoulias
