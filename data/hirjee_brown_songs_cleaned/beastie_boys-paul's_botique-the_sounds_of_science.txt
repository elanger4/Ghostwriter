Now here we go dropping science, dropping it all over
Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizon and expanding the perameter
Expanding the rhymes of sucka MC amateurs
Naugels, Issac Newton a scientific E.Z.
Ben Franklin with the kite, getting over with the key
Now rock, shocker the mike of the many times, times the times tables
Rock well to tell the spell all of the old fables
Cuz I be dropping the new science and I be kicking the new k-nowledge
An MC to a degree that you can't get in college
Now the drags of the Earth and the EGGS that I eat
I got tacks through my hands and one through my feet
Shea Stadium the radium, E.M.D. squared
Kicked out of the Palledium, 'dja think that I cared?
It's the sounds...of science, the sounds...of science

(Ad Rock)
Rope-a-Dope!
the newest in new, "right up to your face and dissed you"
waxin' and milkin' all of you square heads...

Time and money for girls covered with honey
You lie and aspire to be as cunning
Reelin' and rockin' and rollin' B sized D cup
Order the quarter deluxe, why don'tcha wake up
My mind is kinda flowing like an oil projector
Had to get up and get the Jimmy protector
Went bezerk and worked, and exploded
she woke up in the morning and her face was coated
Buddy you study the man on the mic
D, do whatcha like
Drunk as a skunk am I from celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration
Well I figured out who makes the crack it's
The suckas with the badges and the blue jackets
Proffesor of science cuz I keep droppin' it
I smell weak cuz y'all keep poppin' it
People always ask me what's the phenomenon
Yo what's up? Yo what's goin' on
No one really knows what I'm talkin' about
And yeah that's right my name's Yauch...
[DJ scratching]
Ponce De Leon, constantly on
The fountain of youth, not Robotron
Peace is a word I've heard before
So move and move and move up on the dance floor
Cuz I'm gonna die, gonna die one day
Cuz I'm goin' and goin' and goin' this way
Not like a roach or a peace of toast
I'm goin' out first class, ain't goin' out coach
Rock my Adidas, never rock Filas
[I do not sniff the coke, I only smoke the sinsemilla]
Well with my nose I knows and with my scope I scopes
What I live I write and that's strictly rope
I got science for any occasion
Postulating theorems formulating equasions
Cheech wizard in a snow blizzard
Eat a chicken gizzard with a girl named Lizzy
[Dropping science like Galileo dropped the orange]
