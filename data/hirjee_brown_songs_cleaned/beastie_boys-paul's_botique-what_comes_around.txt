[Verse One]
Overripe, fresh skeezed, California females
With three inch, cherry red, puh-press-on, Lee nails
Rrreach into my mind for the rhymes I'm seekin
Like a garbage bag full overflowin now it's leakin
Please, Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your hair
So I can climb up and get into your underwear
You rat soup eatingtest cheating no business punk
You're insecure born in the junkyard with the junk
You've gone wet, look crazy and messed with your head
You fucked around and wound up with the bald skin head
You're all mixed up, like pasta primavera
Yo why'd you throw that chair at Geraldo Rivera man?
Cause one man's ceiling is another man's floor
So get that money out of your ass you whore!
I brought her upstairs onto the roof
I dogged your wife and she is a doofus

[Chorus]
What goes around, comes around
What goes around, comes around
What goes around, comes around
And what comes around, goes around

[Verse Two]
Clean B, cleaning the G
Spot, you know that we've got
The Dolemite house and you have not
Look out my window, look over the city
With two black eyes, your girl ain't that pretty
Why you wanna beat that brat with a bat
Why you wanna treat your girl like that
Living in the rat race, smokin rat weed
Well you reap what you sow when you plant the seed
Bum cheese on rye with ham and prosciutto
Got more Louie than Philip Rizzuto

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Outro]
Check it, check it, check it
What? What, what? Funky, damn!
A funky bam bam bam bam...
Bam! Da-na-na, da-na-na, da-da-na-na-na
Bam! Da-na-na, da-na-na, da-da-na-na-na
Bam! Da-na-na, da-na-na, da-da-na-na-na
Bam! Funky, funky, funky, funky
Funky funky BAM!
Na-na, na-na, na-na
Funky bam everybody everybody funky bam
Bam bam bam slam Alabama, and a kick it
And a funky bama, slam a socky hammer
Chillin, like pencillin
Funky! Doris the Fingasaurus
