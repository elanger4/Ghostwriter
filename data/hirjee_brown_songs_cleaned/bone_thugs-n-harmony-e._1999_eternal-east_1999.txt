[Layzie Bone]
East ninteen ninety nine my niggaz....

Thinkin' bout back in the days when the year was '89
Little nigga on the grind
Gotta get mine doing my crime
Wid two in here
Steady stackin' my ends
Puttin' my serve down on the Claire 9-9
Hittin' up the Graveyard Shift with real
Little Will Big Wally and Wish Bone
Little Wally high rollerz and he wonda why niggaz so strong
Krayzie Bone, stack right check much love
Kept a nigga on his toes in the game
It's an everyday thang when you let ya nuts hang
Gotta make a grand atleast daily man
Them Cleveland hustlaz neva no bustaz thug to the heart
We niggaz from the land fool, and the old school
Just serve out ya sentence and be cool
Fuckin' with Trues rest in peace
My little nigga Ripster stress that Bone luv
Smokin' on bud, cause a nigga Mo Thug
Callin' up my niggaz when it's time to nut up
In the 9-9 niggaz gon' drop to the number 1 with ya gun so run run
Cleveland is the city where a nigga come from
Slangin' them dum dum dum dums

[Krayzie Bone]
Niggaz it's going down, up in the C-Town
Get 'em up with the thug and the nigga with the bud, got the fifth rose
for the liquor store close, hit 'em up with the forty reasons
Nigga roll up the buddah
Smoke it all up nigga don't stiff on the reefer
Mo runnin' up outta the club with this
Plus I got hydro and this shit is creeper creeper
Strip as you hear the double glock glock
Widda me rocks cocked sweatin' me bad
Coppers betta drop when the gunshots pop glock top
Hit the body and the bullshit stop
Wheneva them troublin' us
Where the po-po niggaz roll solo split up and swerve
Krayzie take caution
Take out my llelo and tossed it
Send 'em in the road to the curb
Running, ducking, jumping
Up in the land my niggaz is craaazy
Me slangin' with nuff 'n me bang on the block
And nigga this daaaily
Who the nigga with the 12-guage (Pump)
Mr.Sawed-Off Leatherface so you betta pray
Eternally thugsta
East nine-teen nine-ty nine

[Bizzy Bone]
Gotta give peace to the SCTs
And the one big thug on the glock
Pump blast fa the cash
Then I mashin with gas gotta dash away from the cops
Not lettin' no pause
Steadily flippin' up rows
Rippin' up flesh with six fours
That's that thugsta yes I pump slugs
And I be dropping 'em off in dumpsters
Fuck them po-po, all a dem bodies we burn, burn
And I guess that hood'll neva learn
Got it dipped both in hoes and sherm
When I'm on a mission for my set-ty
Pick up my niggaz be peelin' out with me
Roll up me window me wind blow fuck up my indo
I'm an enemy, even up the barrels of me 12-guage
I empty, me scan-dalous niggaz are pon de loose
But it's no fuckin' with the family
Now feel it nigga understand me
Much love much bud for them St.Claire thugs
East nineteen ninety nine is where ya find me
Slangin' them motherfuckin' drugs

[Flesh N Bone]
Dun dun leavin' the niggaz to cock it pop widda me gun
They know that me noddin' they head off
And I gots to have me fun
Leaving 'em hung, breakin' fakin'
You studio gangsta bitch trick
Niggaz'll get beat
I'm handlin' the shit
And I split in the midst of the darkness
Consider me heartless, oh yes Flesh be runnin' a hoe check
Betta check ya Rolex
Ya timed now fa givin' up respect
Ta them S-C-Ts from C-L-E the scandalous niggaz that dwell
Hell offa the forscythe and bail
Leavin' a trail a the bloody victims
The fifth dog maulin' 'em all, neva them catch me slippin
As if and if and they find
They may give me time instead a me trippin'
We flippin' the scripts on ova
See the Bone a be neva sober
Niggaz told ya triggas showed ya
East nine nine nine five soldiers

[Wish Bone]
Wanna run red rum try to run and get away
But it's just to laaaate
Watch out buckshots when I come buck buck
Betta guard that fuckin' face
Dumpin' them slugs on you fools
Rollin' with me Trues, drinkin' brews
Don't start no shit we come equipped
So niggaz stay cool, one eighty seven
You think that you going to heaven
Put slugs all up in that chest dunn
To hell is where you be dwellin'
Popping a clip in them bodies me dumpin'
Watchin' you fall to the pave
Wid me nine milli pumpin'
Puttin' dem bodies all off in dem graves
