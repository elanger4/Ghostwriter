A convertible Porsche is what Im striving to drive
DJ Polo of course, drives a ride thats live
With a AMG kit, in his pockets a mitt
And if you try to steal his shit, by a pitch you get bit
But yo one day you will see me in a fly Lambourghini
On my way to the beach picking up girls in bikinis
Im a hip-hop star and yo Im bound to go far
And all the girlies jump right on it
When you drive a dope car



Yo I see cars driving by me looking milky and shiny
Tires made from Pirelli getting all of the heinies
Now a few of my friends they drive a Mercedes Benz
All the seats are stitched and hemmed, MCM and gold rims
The people are looking, all the ladies are hooking
All the cops get shooken, suckers girlfriends get tooken
Candy-apple Corvette, Benzy Boss in effect
And you know you get respect cause theyre breaking their necks
To see your car
