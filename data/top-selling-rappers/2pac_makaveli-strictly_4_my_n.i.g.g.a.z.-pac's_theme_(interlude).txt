PAC'S THEME
~Statements variously said throughout song.~ 

I was raised in this society so there's no way
you can expect me to be a perfect person cuz I'm a do what I'm a do.
(I am still thirsty) - Arrested Development
(There is absolutly no reason for a record like this to be published.
It has no place in our society.) - Dan Quayle
(They gotta understand me)
(Withdraw on this record) - Dan Quayle
That's how I feel I'm a do whatever I like. I am not a role model
