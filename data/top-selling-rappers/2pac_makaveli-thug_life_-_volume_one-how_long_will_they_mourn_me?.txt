How long will they mourn me?
Yeah! This for my nigga Kato, it's still on nigga - believe that
We live a Thug Life, Thugs for Life, ha ha
(How long will they mourn me?) We handle this shit for you bwoy
Yeah nigga.. Tupac in this motherfucker

All my homies drinkin liquor, tears in everybody's eyes
Niggaz cried, to mourn a homie's homicide
But I can't cry, instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier?
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckers back before your buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a one-eight-seven
Do real niggaz get to go to heaven?
How long will they mourn me?  Bury me a motherfuckin G
Bitch don't wanna die; then, don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homie's lyin dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm tryin hard to make amends
But I'm losin all my motherfuckin friends.. damn!
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the motherfuckin storm
How long will they mourn me?

[Chorus: Nate Dogg + 2Pac]
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
[2Pac] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
(Half them niggaz all dead and shit)
[2Pac] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
(Dedicated this to Kato nigga, and e'ry thug)
[2Pac] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
(Yo nigga, we gotta keep this shit goin on, yo Syke)

[Big Syke]
How long will they mourn me?  Every motherfuckin day homie
You stayed down when the other niggaz didn't know me
From my heart to the trigger you my fuckin nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin back, you wanted a 'llac
And goin half on a motherfuckin hundred sack
Smokin blunt after blunt, and steady drinkin
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin crazy and runnin out of fuckin time
I can't take it, I'm losin my fuckin mind
So day after day, ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Til we meet again homie - how long will they mourn me?

[Chorus: Nate Dogg + Big Syke]
[Nate] I wish it would have been another (Big Kato)
[Syke] How long will they mourn me? (It's still on nigga)
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
[Syke] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] I wish it would have been another (Yeah)
[Syke] How long will they mourn me?
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
[Syke] Rated R (Double Jeapordy) Mac 10

[The Rated R]
Damn, a nigga tired of feelin sad, I'm tired of puttin in work
I'm tired of cryin watchin my homies leave the - earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin, when they get a call from the coroner
All niggaz can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up, reminiscin how we grew up (my nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato, see you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin of ya homie
Rest in peace.. how long will they mourn me?

[Macadoshis]
We know life's a fuckin trip, and everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato?
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy, it's fuckin with my dome
Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day, of my motherfuckin birth (uh)
But niggaz say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone, bow long will ya mourn me? (YEAH!)

[Chorus: Nate Dogg + 2Pac]
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
(Mac 10 in this motherfucker, yeah!)
[2Pac] How long will you mourn me?!
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
(Thug Life boy, Nate, blowin that shit)
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
(Nate Dogg do that shit nigga, yeah)
[2Pac] How long will you mourn me?!
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
(This for my nigga Kato, and all his kids)
[2Pac] How long will you mourn me?!
[Nate] I wish it would have been another
[Nate] How long.. will they mourn.. my brother
