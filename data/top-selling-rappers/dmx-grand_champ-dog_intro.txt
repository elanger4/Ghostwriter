[Swizz Beatz whispers]
Ruff Ryders
Ride or die
Get at these niggaz dog

[DMX talking]
Yup, yup, yup
I don't really trust humans that much these days
Shit, fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans
Shit, nothing like that dog love I tell ya
Not just any dog, gotta be a pit bull
Yup, that's the only dog for me
You don't wanna get caught in a pit with one of them
They make good companions, but even worse enemies
It's all on how you take it

[DMX verse]
Nothing goes down I don't get a small piece of
Get the picture see the beauty in the beast of
The mad man, Mr. bad man is here
Cause a nigga like me smells wreck in the air
Test they fear shit that I be doing to niggaz
Get away with the same shit ruining niggaz
Cover all ground and I roll thick like the fog
Only motha fuckin' friend I ever had was a dog
Never ate the hog but glad to say I smoked plenty
The fifth precinct to name one of many
In one verse I beat you worse than your momma
I fuck around and eat you first like ???
I'ma, play that ass out like a bomber
Killed a nigga once for looking like he wanted drama
I'm buggin, the pain it hurts I gotta scream
AHHHHH!
Lettin' off a little steam
Society was just too much, I couldn't hack it
Six motha fuckin' years in a straight jacket
Yo black it wasn't wise for them to let me out the joint
Never really got better so I'm not on point
I just might flip, quick, but it's too late to be bitchin'
Got more loose screws than the table in your kitchen
I'm itchen, just hope you ain't around when I scratch
Cause like I said before, I eats what I catch
Searchin' shit will have a nigga hurt and sick
The dirt you kick will get you in the dirt and quick
World premier, you niggaz is kids, don't play
I'm too old for the jokes you'll get smoked, I don't play
I'm gon' say what's gon' happen if you force my hand
Someone somewhere will be like "I lost my man"
Take it to heart it's about to get dark so run that
All that shit niggaz talking been there done that
What black think it's an act, let me know
But he liked what I'm saying so shut the fuck up and let me flow
Yo you think it's a game, keep playing
They gon' find your ass somewhere in a creek laying
It's over you just ain't laid down yet
And in a minute you gon' be that motha fucka' that ain't found yet
Hold off from making movies and make moves
Stop talking about shit that you can't prove
I'm the mountain you can't move, so why you trying
Looking at me stupid wondering why you dying
While you flying
Through the air with a big ass hole in your chest
Wishing you was holding a vest
But it's too late for wishing so all you getting is rest
Go to sleep, pa pa will take care of the stress
God bless and may He have mercy on your soul
POP POP
Take these two more with you on your stroll, nigga

[DMX talking]
Yup, yup, yup
I don't really trust humans that much these days
Shit, fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans
Shit, nothing like that dog love I tell ya
Not just any dog, gotta be a pit bull
Yup, that's the only dog for me
You don't wanna get caught in a pit with one of them
They make good companions, but even worse enemies
It's all on how you take it

You know how we do baby
Aight
Grand champ
You know how we do
Scratch all day, match our weight
Fuck nigga
You can't be fuckin' serious
A raccoon ain't nothing but a big cat
