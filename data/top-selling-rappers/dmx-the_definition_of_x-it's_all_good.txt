Love my niggaz, but where's my bitches? 
I love my niggaz, but where's my bitches? 
Love my niggaz, but where's my bitches? 
I love my niggaz, but where's my bitches? 

Chorus: DMX

It's all good, it's alright 
Fuck all day, fuck all night 
Call my bitches, cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches 
East to the West coast, all my bitches 

[DMX]
Yo
Chickens is good for pluckin so I'm stickin bitches fuckin
Got em trickin while they suckin, give em dick and they be BUGGIN
I've done it all - from mackin two hoes on a three-way
Dominican hoes on B-way, country hoes in V-A
And they all say the same about my game it's tight
That's why every night a different group of bitches start a fight 
over some dick that they don't even own
All I'm givin them is the bone 
Blowin up a niggaz phone, but ain't nobody home (damn)
I'm in the zone, tryin to do things
Let's turn this into a crew thing -- whassup girlfriend, you game? 
Don't wonder why when I leave at night 
It's because I thieve at night
I'm leavin bitches not breathin right 
I fuck they head up with some slick shit 
Hit em off with some long dick shit 
Make it some quick shit, but rip shit 
Then I'm out, just like the trash on a Thursday 
Knowin she'd be givin up the ass on the first date

Chorus 2X

[DMX]
Flocks of bitches by the dozens, from sisters to cousins 
Got em doin shit they said they wasn't ever gonna do 
Like knowin I'd fuck the bitch that she was close to 
Still gave up the ass and dough, she was supposed to (what?)
Pictures of bitches and flicks of chicks 
Videos with the baddest hoes, suckin dick 
It's the dog in me, that makes me do wrong 
And honies can't help but get strung (why?)
Cause the game is too strong (okay)
I like em greedy, black like Edi
Eyes beady, willin to give to the needy 
I done ran through em all, from around the way bitches 
to them outta state hoes, and even hittin gay bitches 
All I tell em is, "Let me get that," then it's on 
Knock her motherfuckin boots, and then I'm gone 
I got the white bitches sayin, "It's a black thing!" 
Cause I leave that hoe with no dough and plenty of back pain 

Chorus 2X

[DMX]
Bitches who get props, cause they know who can get got 
And they can get shot, by the way a niggaz lip drop 
Walk up in the spot, knowin what she want strictly
When hon wants the dickly, hon comes and gets me 
Hits me, pays me, doesn't get crazy
Knows to be Swayze, cause that's daddy's baby
I keep them hoes in check, like the government 
Hittin em off with nuttin BUT THE DICK, and they lovin it!
Huggin it, like it's they best friend, cause it is
Word to Miz, fuckin with tricks is just biz 
I deal with strictly dimes 
Got em committin they first crimes 
Now she suckin dick, for the first time 
And ain't no secret, bout how I freak it, when they sleep
didn't never know how I peeped it, then creeped it
That's how I know this must be that shit 
I tell them bitches, "I'll be back," and they believe that shit!

Chorus 4X

[DMX]
I love my niggaz, but where's my bitches? (4X)
Nigga..
