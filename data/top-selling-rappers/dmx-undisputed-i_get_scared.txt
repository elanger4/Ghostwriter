[Intro: DMX]
Uh-oh, uh-oh (grr, grr, grr, grr)
Uh-oh, uh-oh (grr, grr, grr, grr)
OH MY GOD! (grrrrrrrrr, shhh)

[Rachel Taylor] + (DMX)
I, I get scared, when it comes (when it comes)
But I know, I'm gon-na be, alright
I get scared, when it comes (when it comes)
(But I know I'm gonna be alright)

[Chorus: DMX] + (Rachel Taylor)
I, get scared - I get scared when it comes (when you're gooooone)
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, get scared (I get scared) when it comes (when you're gooooone)
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[DMX]
Y'all don't know, things I know
Where I've been and, where I go
Y'all don't know cause y'all can't see
Look, you do you, let me be me
Y'all don't know the, pain I felt
or, how I play the cards I was DEALT
Y'all don't know what you're talkin about!
So y'all, need to stop RUNNIN YOUR MOUTH!
BECAUSE

[Chorus] w/ variations

[DMX]
I get down for real, all I know is one way
Sunday to Sunday, only game is gunplay
And I know that one day, I'm gon' get it
Until I get it... get it
We gets it in like a fat bitch cookin
Like a nosy bitch that's lookin
Been had the gauge huntin, since the age 11
Niggaz think you on stage you frontin - look here
I'm that nigga, if I knock on your door
You gon' look in my eyes and be like, "Dog, what's wrong?"
You feel it like I feel it, somethin in the air
Wait, c'mere, yeah it's comin from right THERE!

[Chorus] w/ variations

[Rachel Taylor]
I, I get scared, when it comes
But I know, I'm gon-na be, alright
I get scared when you're gooooooooooooooone
I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be alright (gonna be alright)

[Chorus] w/ variations

[DMX]
I know they love me real, so why pretend?
Make a nigga take it back to where it all began
I mean, even we went, yeah it's that bad
Don't let me catch you slippin, yeah I'm THAT MAD!
When the Dog come through and there's no cats to trace
I'm sure there's somethin else to try to take off his face
Yeah you was in the wrong place, at the wrong time
I'm takin everything you got, I want it ALL MINE
How a nigga gon' stop me when, I don't Stop for signs
Yeah you got mine, don't start lyin
Understand a nigga tryin, but don't stop it from happenin
But I guess they won't GET IT, until I start clappin!
