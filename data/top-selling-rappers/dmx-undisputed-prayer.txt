Lord Jesus; you have brought me from a place so dark
to the point, where I can now feel love in my heart
And I know it's just a start, and there is more to come
So now I embrace it, when I used to run
Didn't know what I was running from or, running towards
'Til one day I saw it, I was running for the Lord
And when I came back, you accepted me with open arms
and said, "All is forgiven," and I became so strong
that, I can fight off the Devil with the spoken word
SAYING, "Devil I rebuke you," that's all that was heard
Cause no matter what I've been through, I could deal with it
Because of what I went through, I was still fitted
with the armor, that comes with the blood of Jesus
Among evil and suffering, He sees us
But when you're LOST, He will lead the flock to find the one
Just like any father trying to find his son
And let me remind you, no matter where you're at He will FIND you!
And help you put the enemy behind you
LORD GIVE ME A SIGN! Please let me know you're here
Or at least, let me know, you're near
Remind me to call you, when we need you
Remind me to call you, because we all need to
AND GIVE US THE STRENGTH TO MAKE IT THROUGH JUST ONE MORE DAY!
IN JESUS MIGHTY NAME WE PRAY!
Amen
