[Intro: DMX]
Yeah! Uh! In the name of Jesus (spread the word!)
"No weapon formed against me shall prosper" (PREACH!)
"And every turn that rise against my judgment, thou shall condemn" (PREACH!)
(LORD GIVE ME A SIGN!) For this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord
(PREACH!) "And their righteousness is of me," said the Lord (PREACH!)
Amen... uh! Lord give me a sign!

[DMX]
I really need talk to you Lord
Since the last time we talked, the walk has been hard
Now I know you haven't left me, but I feel like I'm alone
I'ma big boy now, but I'm still not grown
And I'm still goin through it (WHAT!), pain and the hurt (YEAH!)
Soakin up trouble like rain in the dirt (YEAH!)
And I know! If only I can stop the rain
With just the mention of my savior's name.. in the name of Jesus!
Devil I rebuke you, for what I go through
Been tryna make me do, what I used to (WHAT!)
But all that stops right here (YEAH!)
As long as the Lord's in my life, I will have no fear
I will know no pain from the light to the dark (COME ON!)
I will no show no shame, spit it right from the heart (COME ON!)
'Cause it's right from the start, you held me down
And ain't.. nothin they can tell me now!
LORD GIVE ME A SIGN!

[Chorus] {*singing*}
Let me know what's on yo' mind
Let me know what I'm gon' find
It's all in time, show me how to teach the mind
Show me how to reach the blind (LORD GIVE ME A SIGN!)
Show me what I gotsta do, to bring me closer to you
As I'ma go through, whatever you want me to
Just let me know what to do (LORD GIVE ME A SIGN!)

[DMX]
Please, show me some'n (some'n)
I'm tired talkin to him, knowin he frontin (frontin)
Cryin 'bout, "Life ain't nothin" (nothin)
But you either, be the one mad 'cause you trapped or the one huntin (COME ON!)
Trapped in yo' own mind, waitin on the Lord (YEAH!)
Or huntin with the word that cuts like a sword
The spoken word is stronger than, the strongest man
Carries the whole world like the strongest hand
Through the trials and tribulations, you never let us down
JESUS! I know you're here with us now
JESUS! I know you're still with us now
Keep it real with us now, I wanna feel, show me how
PLEASE! Let me take yo' hand, guide me! (WHAT!)
I'll walk slow but stay right beside me!
(PLEASE!) Devil's tryna find me! (PLEASE!)
Hide me! Hold up, I take that back
Protect me and give me the strength to fight back! (LORD GIVE ME A SIGN!)

[Chorus]
[DMX] {*singing*} w/ choir in background
Life or death, live or die (UH!)
I will never live a lie (UH!)
I'm gon' get because I try (WHAT!)
I won't quit until I die (WHAT!)
I'm gon' make it, wrong or right (YEAH!)
And make it through the darkest time (YEAH!)
And when the morning comes, you'll see
that all I have is God in me! (LORD GIVE ME A SIGN!)
