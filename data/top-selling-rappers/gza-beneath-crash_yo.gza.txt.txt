[GZA]
You know exactly what i'm talking about,
Y'know?

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I'm gonna crash your crew (x8)

[GZA]
Left drink wine, from the purist grapevine
An' rhyme out the mutherfucking mind
Metal shine, light blind, cut the mic line
Catch juice from the ?land fo?
15 twenty inch woofers blow the manhole
Made the street crack, master feedback
?Allah masters the beat back?
The crowd look, while the stage shook
Carpenters made errors
Craftsmen had his head severed
Pyroclastic flow, heavy like tonnes of snow
Broke this rhymin' video
Verbal assassin, blastin
Exploit your break through explosively
Echo chamber ate that rap up ferociously
Game controlled, optimize the input channel
I set it relatively high for those on a panel
CD with the durable, long-life cover
Very similar to no other
I seen a million tryin' to set a flow
Thousands that show
Observe with the patience of watching a flower grow
But one individual thing forgot the ?fri show?
Now his pursuit is not for digress
A special note, thanks for being flank
While journalist's stay runnin' in front of tanks
Blew out first class, came back close cash
Ruff class, surfaces with no math
Military campaign, while shots cause information of the brain
Beat Crazy Eddie insane
*cra-cra-cra-cra-cra-cra...*
Filled with pain -- niggaz reign
