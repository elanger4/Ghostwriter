[La the Darkman]
Yeah, killa, The GZA, La
Live, yeah, what yo
My clan is like USA the way we conquer
Lay back, grow more chocolate than Willy Wonka
Stomp ya, till your head bleed, your mouth bleed
Runnin wit the heart of slave that's been freed
Triple Darkness, wild like a killer from Sparfit
Heartless, trained to hit movin targets
Profit, .357 cocked it
Killed you, leave you wit your money in your pocket
My logic, money bitches layin the lessons
Allah blesses, me wit automatic weapons
Scholastic, geographic, stay jurassic
Runnin through Medina wit the glock blastin
Rotten fruit, Black Je-sus, I got juice
Darkman move swift as a mongoose

[Timbo King]
Yo, niggas caught plaque from bitin off the platinum
Dumb MC's caught the gum disease, ask them
Who style they took, two wild rooks
Tried to take a page when I'm the author of the book
At twenty-seven years young, y'all some old timers
I write wit invisible ink, y'all use eye liners
Define rhymers, the question and the answer
The DJ and the dancers, check
