Artist: The Genius
Album:  Words From the Genius
Song:   True Fresh MC

CHORUS:
I rock the mic at any party
And in the place to be
I'm a true, true fresh MC
I'm a true fresh MC

I work real hard to achieve my goal
From building and bringing out my true inner soul
Which was once on a downfall and then uplifted
So why live life foul when you're talented and gifted
I've changed, rearranged my total direction
Searchin' for happiness, seeking for perfection
Living the true life, a real story
To make you realize the truth, not scream Glory
Glory, hallelujah, not here to fool ya
But to replenish your souls as I school ya
With a greeting of Purified Education
Always Correcting Errors which stops the temptation
Of you doing wrong singing the same sad song
Renewing bad histories for how long
A Long long time ago
Going fo rmind made The Genius a pro
And as you see who I be
I be The Genius and thus a true M.C.

CHORUS

Brothers need to study some lessons

They are the blessings to keep you from guessing
the questions that is asked by the seeker
Put on the beat and let me born it through the speaker
Peace, a lot of MC's like to say it
And some that advocate it they just spray it
Out and scream and shout, beyond the shadow of a doubt
They don't know what it's about
Just to keep you informed with the significance
How can I prove this through true evidence
Some make me laugh, think they droppin' math
Show and proven is a difficult path
Within teh five percent, I am the live percent
Those who perpetrate are the jive percent
I be the universal, the Biochemical
Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head is the physical
That keeps rhymin' until it's unbearable
No individual is comparable
You have aproblem inform the technician
But he's not dealing with those of superstition
Those who like dealing with it superstitiously
Cross your fingers when you steppin' to me
I don't nee beefs and problems, riffs and static
Debates and arguments that snot dramatic
I need action, it speaks louder than a word
Especially when the word is loud and unheard
Word is what?  My word is bond, your word is bull
Now it's your card I'm gonna pull
