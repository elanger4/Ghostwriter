[Kanye West]
Didn't you know, I was waitin on you
Waitin on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know, I was waitin on you
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When you decide to break the rules
Cause I just heard some real bad news
People'll talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you how long have you known dude
You played it off and act like he's brand new
When you decide, to break the rules
Cause I just heard some real bad news

Real bad news
Real bad news
Real bad news
Oh you just gon' keep another no you won't
Oh you just gon' keep it like you never knew
Oh you just gon' keep another lover you
Oh you just gon' keep it like you never knew
While I'm waitin on a dream that'll never come true
Oh you just gon' keep it like you never knew
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
What's on the news?
