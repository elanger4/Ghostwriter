[Kanye West - singing softly, gradually singing louder]
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
and that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, {SYSTEM OVERLOAD}
Screamin, "No, no, no, n-nooooo..."
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Chorus]
So keep your looove lock-down - your love lockdown
Keeping your looove lock-down - your love lockdown
Now keep your LOOOVE lock-down - your LOVE lockdown
Now keep your LOOOVE lock-down - you looooose

I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep my-self, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from HOME, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You looooooose, you looooooose
I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just wast-in time, where's the finish line?

[Chorus]

I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin, keep the lovin goin
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
if I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choooooose, you choooooose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times befo'
I'm not lovin you, way I wanted to

[Chorus]

You loooooose...
You loooooose...
You loooooose...
You loooooooo-oose...
