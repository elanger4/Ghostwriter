[Intro: Kanye West] + (DJ Khaled)
Uhh... can the headphones go louder?
(KANYE WEST~!!) Yeah
Swag King Cole
(DJ KHALED~!!)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Can't a young nigga get money anymore?
Tell PETA my mink is draggin on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
come to meet me, without no drawers?

[Kanye West]
Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you muh'fuckers it was more than the music
In the projects one day, to +Project Runway+
We done heard all that loud-ass talkin, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think they words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it

[Bridge]
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrassed you

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim
around the time she had fell in love with him
Well that's cool, baby girl, do your thang
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team
La Familia, Roc Nation
We in the buildin, we still keep it basement

[Bridge]

[Kanye West]
G.O.O.D. Music, we fresh, we fresh
Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass niggaz got ass and breasts
All that said, lemme ask this quest

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
Don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga
I'll muh'fuckin embarrass you
Talking 'bout clothes, I'll muh'fuckin embarrass you
Hollerin 'bout some hoes, I'll muh'fuckin embarrass you
Way too cold, I promise you need some Theraflu

[Outro]
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh) Get the Theraflu
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh) Get the Theraflu
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh uh) Get the Theraflu
