[The-Dream]
Look at yo' money
Ooh mama, this could be you
On the right side of this drop
Ooh mama, throw it in reverse
I call that back it up and drop, uh
Baby, baby baby, baby baby
Baby, baby baby, baby baby
Baby, baby baby, baby baby
Baby, baby baby, baby baby
Ohh, girl I think that she like
I got that shit that make niggaz wan' fight
I got that shit that make bitches act right
Make bitches act out of spite, aight
Ohh mama, I got that bomb
I got that shit make ya ass go run
My shit knock, make niggaz get guns
But the white girls say "Where you get that cool beat from?"

[Interlude: The-Dream]
She love it (she love it)
Every beat of the drum, she's sprung
She say I make her wanna touch it, she love it (she love it)
She make me wanna touch it, I love it (I love it)

[Chorus: The-Dream + John Legend]
We buzzin, yeah
Hiiiiigher than a motherfucker
Hiiiiigher than a motherfucker
Hiiiiigher than a motherfucker, yeah (yo!)

[Pusha T]
I've been known to chase 'em, known to replace 'em
Shoe game out of this world, I outer space 'em
Known to have +101+ like +Dalmations+
Maybe if she's special enough I'll glass case her
Get caught cheatin and I gotta let you stick me up
Let you shop 'til you drop as a pick-me-up
Bergdorf bandit, Barney's for the burglary
But these bands lift the whole store like Hercules
Get raunchy in Givenchy, my palm reads
Passports, Pinot Noir in arm's reach
Paddle shiftin, push button, no car keys
The penthouses are poolside with palm trees

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Ma$e]
Uh, one-two one-two, guess who back again (uh)
Harlem in this (what) Yeezy let Manhattan in (c'mon)
Get my mic right (yeah) turn my levels up (uhh)
Get the light right (what?) turn my bezel up
You either bounce on it, go 'head throw your mouth on it
So many Ghosts in my garage they think my house haunted (uhh)
Long as my buckle say Hermes, the rumors I'm not concerned with
They wanna garnish my earnings, before I send it I burn it
You know them people too convinced that my money's gettin rinsed
Her Lou' B's 7-inch, they TMZ me through my tint
I bumped into Loon, he like "Well as-salamu alaykum" (what?)
You know I ain't Muslim my nigga, I'm about my bacon (okay)
The shot niggaz takin you'd think I'm rollin 'round with Reagan (uh-huh)
A Mexican landscapin couldn't rake in what I'm makin
Think you blew me up, with your bougie butt
But you ain't slow me up, I'm on the charts, you move me up
I'm like a drug overlord, my jewelry's overboard
It's hard believe dollar-sign-E, even know the Lord
Already wrote it off, so just ignore the cost
So when I'm rollin off I'm showin off with no remorse
Sha'mon!

[Chorus]

[Cocaine 80's + John Legend]
Bitch (bitch bitch) hold the smoke (smoke) longer
Chokehold so strong broke your armor
Now you're wide open, right?
You ain't even smokin right
Bitch (bitch) hold the smoke
Cough hoe (Harpo) Harpo
Purple got ya knocked out
Now you know you're smokin loud (got you chokin loud)
You're higher than a motherfucker
High in this bitch, I'm high as a motherfucker
I'm high and this bitch fine as a muh'fucker
I'm high as a muh'fucker
I hear sirens, she dyin in this motherfucker
Moment of silence, for this motherfucker
I'm just higher than a motherfucker
I'm higher than a motherfucker
I'm higher than a mother
