"BELIEVE! BELIEVE!"

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
O-o-o-o-o-okay, Lamborghini Mercy, yo' chick she's so thirsty
I-I-I-I'm in that two-seat Lambo wit yo' girl, she tryin to jerk me

[Chorus]

[Big Sean] + (Kanye West)
Swerve, swerve... boy, boy, okay...
Drop it to the floor, make that ass shake
Whoa, make the ground move, that's an ass quake
Built a house up on that ass, that's an ass state
Ro-ro-roll my weed on it, that's an ass tray
Say 'Ye, say 'Ye, don't we do this every day-day? (Huh!)
I work them long nights, long nights to get a pay day (Huh!)
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
(And niggas still hating) so much hate I need an AK
Now we out in Paris, yeah I'm Perriering
White girls politicking that's that Sarah Palin
G-g-g-g-gettin high, Californicating
I give her that D, cause that's where I was born and raised in

[Chorus] {*w/ Big Sean saying "Swerve" 8X*}

[Interlude] {*w/ Big Sean saying "Swerve" 8X*} + "BELIEVE! BELIEVE!"

[Pusha T]
Yugh! It's primetime, my top back, this pimp game
Hoe~! I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James
Hoe~! I'm bill droppin, Ms. Pac-Man is pill-poppin
Asshole! I'm poppin too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money, all she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out, I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist, them heads turnin, that's exorcist
My Audemar like Mardi Gras, that's Swiss time and that's excellence
Two-door, preference, roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that poundcake so your Duncan Hines is irrelevant
WOO! Lambo, Mercy-lago
She go wherever I go, wherever we go we do it pronto
It's like

[Chorus] {*w/ Big Sean saying "Swerve" 8X*}

[Interlude] {*w/ Big Sean saying "Swerve" 8X*} + "BELIEVE!"

[Fuzzy Jones sample]
"Well! It is a weepin and a moanin and a gnashing of teeth in di dancehall
 And who nuh have teeth gwaan run pon dem gums 
 Cah when time it comes to my sound, which is di champion sound
 Di bugle has blown the many times, and it still have one more time left
 Cah di amount of stripe weh deh pon our shoulder"

[Kanye West]
Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam building like I'm the shit
Tell 'em give me 50 million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up in yo' face level
Don't do no press but, I get the most press kid
Plus yo, my bitch make yo' bitch look like Precious
Talkin 'bout Mary, she gone off that Molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dal√≠
Now everybody is movin they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby
Niggaz is loiterin just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers, and niggaz in Jordans

[2 Chainz]
2 Chainz!
Okay now catch up/ketchup to my campaign, coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time drinkin champagne on the airplane
Spit rounds like the gun range, beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl, now yo' girl need a Band-Aid
Grade A, A-1, chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhymin, co-signin by Louis Vuitton (yup!)
Horse power, horse power, all this Polo on I got horse power
Pound of this cost four thousand, I make it rain she want more showers
Rain (rain) pourin (pourin) all my cars is foreign (foreign)
All my broads is foreign (foreign) money tall like Jordan

[Chorus] {*w/ Big Sean saying "Swerve" 8X*}

[Interlude] {*w/ Big Sean saying "Swerve" 8X*}

[Interlude] + "BELIEVE! BELIEVE!"
