[Chorus: Kanye West]
We gone through too much bullshit

She gone through too much bullshit

We go... through too...

All of these drunk and hot girls
 
[Kanye West]
Drivin 'round town lookin for the best spot
for the - drunky hot girls...
Up in the club look at here what we got
Some - drunky hot girls...
Stop dancin with yo' girlfriend and come dance with me
Stop talkin 'bout yo' boyfriend since he is not me
Stop runnin up my tab cause these drinks is not free
You drunken hot girl
 
[Chorus]  change first word "We" to "She"
 
[Kanye West]
I don't wanna drop yo' friends off I just want you
You - drunky hot girl...
You wanna sit down but we hit the drive-thru
You - drunky hot girl...
Please don't fall asleep baby we almost back
Please don't throw up in the car we almost crashed
Oh now you sober, how'd I know you'd say that?
You drunken hot girl
 
[Chorus]  change first word "We" to "She"
 
[Mos Def]
Love the dangerous necessity that people seek without regard
To where they are the human heart is curious...
Above all things...
Love the lights are low, your eyes are bright
The music plays in sweet light
It's our side, I'm feelin right, your dress is tight
Ohh owwwww-howwwwww, I want you right now
 
[Kanye West]
Don't tell me you sing you 'bout to get a deal
You - drunky hot girl...
Ahh-dah-dah-dah-dah that's how the fuck you sound
You - drunky hot girl, yeah
You only live once, do whatever you like
I thought I'd be wit'chu for, only one night
Now I'm with this girl for the rest of my life
That drunken hot girl
 
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Man, she go through too much bullshit 
just to mess with these drunk and hot girls (have a lil' sippy-sippy)
We gone through too much bullshit 
just to mess with these drunk and hot girls (she say she want a Brewski?)
We go... through too...
much shit... to mess...
mess with... these drunk...
All of these drunk and hot girls
