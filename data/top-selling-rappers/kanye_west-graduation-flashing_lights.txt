[Intro - Sample]
Flashing... lights
Flashing... lights
Flashing... lights
Flashing... lights

[Verse 1 - Kanye West]
She don't believe in shootin stars 
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment 
Couture from the store's departments
You more like love to start shit  
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors d'oeuvres views of the water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy, man why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin so sleazy
I get a call like where are you Yeezy?
And try to hit you with the ol' whopty
Till I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis

[Chorus - Dwele] (Sample)
As I recall I know you love to show off (Off)
But I never thought that you would take it this far (Far)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
Knoowwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!

[Verse 2 - Kanye West]
I know it's been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
I know it was foul baby
A bay, lately, you been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin like Katrina with no F.E.M.A.
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin, hey Mona Lisa come home
You know you can't +Rome+ without +Caesar+

[Chorus] (Repeat 2x)
As I recall I know you love to show off (Off)
But I never thought that you would take it this far (Far)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
Knoowwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!
As I recall I know you love to show off (Off)
But I never thought that you would take it this far (Far)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
What do I know? (Flashing... lights)
Knoowwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!

[Outro - Sample]
Flashing... lights
Flashing... lights
Flashing... lights
Flashing... lights
