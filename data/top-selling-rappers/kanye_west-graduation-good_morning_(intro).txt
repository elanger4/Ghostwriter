[Kanye West]
Uhh... uhh
Good morning! {*repeat 4X*}

Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister - by hisself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test
You got D's, m'uhfucker D's~! Rosie Perez
And yeah that's barely passed, an E in every class
Lookin at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homey this shit is basic, welcome to graduation

Good morning! {*repeat 4X*}

Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from a eighth to a ki'
But you graduate when you make it up out of the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters sayin you changed, now you doin your thang

Good morning! {*repeat 4X*}

Good morning and, look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but we still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preachers, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stoled yo' streetness
After alla that you received this

[Kanye West and Jay-Z sample - repeat 3X]
Good morning! ("Hustlers that's if you're still living
Get on down") Every time that we hit 'em

Good morning! ("Hustlers that's if you're still living
Get on down... get on down...
Get, get on down... get on down...
Get, get on down...")
