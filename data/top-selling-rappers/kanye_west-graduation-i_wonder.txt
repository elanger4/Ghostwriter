[Intro]
Find your dreams come true
And I wonder
If you know
What it means
What it means
And I wonder
If you know
What it means
What it means
And I wonder
If you know
What it means
To find your dreams
And I wonder...

[Verse One: Kanye West]
I've been waitin' on this my whole life
These dreams be wakin' me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what? Maybe you're right... a'ight?

[Chorus]
And I wonder
If you know
What it means
What it means
And I wonder
If you know
What it means
To find your dreams
And I wonder...

[Verse Two]
You say he get on yo' FUCK-in nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves... word?
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just tryn' find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is 
It ain't happen yet and that's where the tuition is
Will you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib, run back to their arms?
The smoke screens, the chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic where my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name will help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm...
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch God callin' from the hotlines
Why He keep givin' me hotlines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Somethin' in ya blouse got me feelin' so aroused
What you about?
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?
