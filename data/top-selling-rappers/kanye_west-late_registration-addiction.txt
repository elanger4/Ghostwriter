[sung]
You make me smiiiiiiile with my heart, ohh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Why everything that's 'sposed to be bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could, but
(You make me smiiiiiiile)

[Kanye West]
What's your addiction?  Is it money?  Is it girls?  Is it weed?
I've been afflicted, by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
And she's comin over, so I guess, that means, I'm her drugs
Just let me peak now, I mean dang, I'm so, curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need you, to be spon-taneous
Roll up the doja, Henny and C-Ca-Coca-Cola
Then I'm c-comin over, cause it's n-never over

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
I see the emotion, in your eyes, that you tried, not to show
We get the closest, when you high, or you drunk, or you blowed
So I pour the potion, so we can both, get high, as we can go
Then I'll get the lotion, it do somethin to me, when your thighs, is exposed
There's no turnin back now, I mean I, don't mean, to impose
Not now but right now, I need you, to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doja, Henny and C-Ca-Coca-Cola
And I keep com-comin over, cause it's n-never over, uhh

[Chorus] 

[Strings]
Why everything that's 'sposed to be bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man, I tried the best I could, but
(You make me smiiiiiiile)

(You make me smiiiiiiile with my heart, ohh)

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
I, just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to umm, let me how would I put this umm
Let's say, of your friends
Remember the one, huh?
You said, if you ever she would be the one
Okay, okay, okay, well, I was thinkin
Hypothetically, I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me, I mean just, umm, not credibly
I, feel it incredibly
I mean let's let it be, I, just let it be
I mean you her and me, I mean you her and me
Baby?  Baby?  Baby?
Baby?  Baby?
You know I was just kiddin
Unless you gon' do it
(You make me smiiiiiiile)
