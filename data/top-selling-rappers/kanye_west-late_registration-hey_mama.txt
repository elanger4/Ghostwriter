[Intro]
I want everybody to put they hands together for me
I want to talk about somebody real special tonight (whooooaaaa)
ok, come on

[Chorus]
Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you
Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you I'm going back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me, I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)

[Verse 1]
I want to tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine, I'm feelin' let it shine
I'm feelin' take y'all back to them better times
I'm feelin' talk about my momma if y'all don't mind (Hey Mama)
I was 3 years old when you and I move to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fix me up something that was good for my soul
Famous home chicken soup, can I have another bowl (Hey Mama)
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I can keep on my bike
And you would give me anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and the glove, but didn't give me a curl (Hey Mama)
And you never put no man over me, and I love you for that mommy can't you see
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cause a nigga cheat and telling you lies, then I started to cry (Hey Mama)
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'm a love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't got to work no more
And I'm a get you that mansion that we couldn't afford (Hey Mama)
See your unbreakable, unmistakable, highly capable, lady that's making loot
A living legend too, just look at what heaven do, send us an angel
And I thank you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Forest Gump momma said, life was like a box of chocolates
My momma told me go to school, get your doctorate
Something to fall back on, you can profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite (Hey Mama)
Now I feel like there's things I gotta get, things I gotta do
Just to prove to you, you was getting through
Can the choir please, gimme a verse of you, eyes so beautiful, to me (Hey Mama)
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry, Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni
Turn one page and there's my mommy (Hey Mama)
Come on mommy just dance with me, let the whole world see you dance with thee
Now when I say hey, y'all say mama
Now everybody answer me

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
I guess it all depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon' get that Benzo, tint the windows
Ride around the city and let your friends know (Hey Mama)

[Verse 3]
Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'm a get you a Jag whateva else you want (Hey Mama)
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday, for me to just call and say

[Outro]
Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you
Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (Hey Mama)
You know I love you so, I'm gonna let you go
I wrote this song just so you know no matter where you go I'ma love you...
