[Intro - John Legend]
I...

[Kanye] Whose fault?

[John Legend]
Let's play the blame, game 
I love you, more
Let's play the blame, game for sure
Let's call her names, names 
I hate you, more
Let's call her names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for short..
As a last resort, and my first resort..
You call me motherfucker for long..
At the end of it you know we both were wrong..

[Chours: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame, game 
I love you, more
Let's play the blame, game for sure
Let's call her names, names 
I hate you, more
Let's call her names, names, for sure

[Kanye West]
On a bathroom wall I wrote,
"I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else" 
{else, else, else, else, else...}
I took a piss and dismiss it like "Fuck it!", and I went and found somebody else 
{else, ELSE, ELSE, ELSE, ELSE...}
Fuck arguin or harvestin the feelings, yo I rather be by my fuckin self
{self, self, self, self, self...}
'Til about two AM and I call back and I hang up and start to blame myself 
Somebody help

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
You wahn't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface..
Been a long time since I spoke to you 
in a bathroom grippin you up, fuckin and chokin you
...What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't gettin this type of dick from that local dude
..And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'cause I definitely be havin mine
{*vocal tone changes frequently*} And you ain't finna see a, mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other niggaz is strokin you
Might say I hit you, he sittin there consolin you
Runnin my name through the mud, who's provokin you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
One AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm callin your brother's phone like, "What was I supposed to do?"
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop askin questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrest'ers
I heard he bought some coke with my money -- dat ain't right girl
You gettin blackmailed, for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl"
You'll probably find one of them "I like art" type girls
All of the lights, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame? You to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame...

[John Legend]
Let's play the blame, game 
I love you, more
Let's play the blame, game, for sure

[Kanye West]
"Things used to be, now they not
 Anything but us is who we are
 Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
 We've become public enemies
 We walk away like strangers in the street
 Gone for eternity, we erased one another
 So far from where we came
 With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
 Lack Of Visual Empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
 Hatred and Attitude Tear us Entirely"
- Khloe Mitchell

[Chorus - Kanye West sings it this time]

[Kanye West]
I cain't love you this much
I cain't love you this much..
I cain't love you this much
I cain't love you this much
I cain't love you this much
No, I cain't love you this much...
I cain't love you this much
I cain't love you this much
And I know that you are somewhere doin ya thing
And when the phone called it just rang and rang
You ain't pick up, but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thang..heh
I heard the whole thang, the whole thang, the whole thang, whole thaaaaaaaaang...

[Outro: Chris Rock] (woman)
Aw, my God!

(Yeezy reupholstered my pussy.)
You know what? I gotta thank Yeezy
