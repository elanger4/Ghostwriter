[Nicki Minaj - Intro]
You might think you've peeped the scene, you haven't
The real one's far too mean
The watered-down one, the one you know
was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful, blasted boring
Twisted fiction, sick addiciton
Well gather 'round children - ZIP IT LISTEN!

{"Could we get much higher?" <- Mike Oldfield}

Soooooooooo.... (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
hiiiiiiiiiiigh... Ohhhhhhhh-ohh-ohhhhhh
{"Could we get much higher?" <- Mike Oldfield}
So high (Oh, oh, oh)
Ohhhhhhhh-ohhh-ohhhhhhhhh (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
Could we get much higher?
So high (Oh, oh, oh)
Ohhhhhhhh - ohhhhhhhhh (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)

Yeah..

I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, Mercy Me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs' need to listen to the models
You ain't got no FUCKIN Yeezy in yo' Serato? (You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga~?!!)
Stupid, but what the fuck do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

{"Could we get much higher?" <- Mike Oldfield}
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh (WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!)
Oh, oh

Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
+Sex is on Fire+, I'm the +King of Leon+/Leona Lewis/Louis
Beyond the truest
+Hey Teacher+ teacher, tell me how do you respawn the students
and refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance, we've killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin down the window
Too many Urkels' on your team, that's why your wins' low/you're Winslow
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull out the tooooo-ooo-ooo-oooys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make nooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-oooooise

  So high (Oh, oh, oh)
  (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)

At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no pa-rents
Then the sky filled heron
I saw the devil, in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
(And moved her back to Pa-ris)

{"Could we get much higher?" <- Mike Oldfield}

So high (Oh, oh, oh)
Soooooooooo.... (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
hiiiiiiiiiiigh... 

Oh

{"Could we get much higher?" <- Mike Oldfield}
So high (Oh, oh, oh)
Ohhhhhhhh-ohhh-ohhhhhhhhh (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
Could we get much higher?
So high (Oh, oh, oh)
Ohhhhhhhh - ohhhhhhhhh (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
Could we get much higher?
So high (Oh, oh, oh)
Ohhhhhhhh, ohh-ohhhhhhh (Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
Whooooa-ooooh-oh
