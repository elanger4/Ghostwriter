[Justin Vernon - vocoder: 3X]
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
to slow down the time

[Chorus 2X: Kanye and Justin - mix of vocoder and normal voice]
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city
and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she's down for the night

[Kanye West]
You're my Devil, you're my Angel
You're my Heaven, you're my Hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma-ma-se, ma-ma-sa, ma-ma-ma-coo-sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid, yeah

[Female backing vocalist]
Run from the lights
Run from the night
Run for your life
Down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night

[Justin Vernon beneath backing vocalist]
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still

[Chorus]

"Who will survive in America?" - Gill-Scott Heron sample *4X*

[Chorus: 2X]
