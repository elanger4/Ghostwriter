[Intro: Luther (Jamie Foxx)]
Are you gonna be? Say that you're gonna be
Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooooo

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx (Luther)]
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She said she want some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
(*talking*)
It definitely will
You know what I told her
(*rapping)
I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'mma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbin me, callin me +Biggie+ like +Shyne+ home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lyin though?
Tellin me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played 'ready for the world', she was ready for some action
My dawg said you ain't no freak , so you bout to prove my man wrong
I'mma lay this Vandross, you gon take yo pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon get right

Repeat Chorus

[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]

Smokey Robinson
Freddie Jackson

Ashford & Simpson (Are you gonna be)
Set the party, really set the party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
are you gonna be, are you gonna be)
Yes it will, yes it will (Well well well well)
Al Green, OH!
Al Green, OHHHHH YEAH!!!
OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
Whatcha know about the Isley Brothers?

[*Aisha Taylor talking over ad-libs*]
Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster baby
can you please - do it faster, do it faster

[*Kanye talking*]
Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!

[Verse 2: Twista]
When I catch you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm layin' back smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rockin the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you when I'm messin wit Kan man and Twist
In the Chi and I be sippin hennessey - play some R&B
While I smoke a b - you can preferably find that I'm a G
And all this (well well well well)
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Hit the stop light, move it to some Isaac
His rims still movin so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b - dippin through the streets
Bumpin R&B - and I got the leaf - on the 23's
And I do it (well well well well)
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin deep sex
You ready for the world girl, baby come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment controlling me
I love the way you be holdin me when I be listenin to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend ya ass, you be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow
Now I got to go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, come to the club wit me
And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin me
and still will be in love wit me

Repeat Chorus
