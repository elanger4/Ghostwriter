[Intro]
"Bound to fall in love"
"Bound to fall in love" ("Uh-huh, honey")

[Chorus: Kanye West]
All them other niggaz lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you s'posed to drown
Bound... ("Bound to fall in love")
Bound... ("B-B-B-B-Bound to fall in love")
("Uh-huh, honey")

[Kanye West]
What you doin in the club on a Thursday?
She said she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirs-tay
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thir-tay
I know I got a bad reputation
Walk-around-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a +Fight Club+, Brad-reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the PLANE around, yo' ass keep complainin
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty winin 'round all these Jamaicaaaans~!
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, NO- ("Uh-huh, honey")

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Bound... ("Bound to fall in love")
Bound... ("Bound to fall in love")
("Uh-huh, honey")

[Kanye West]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
'ey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admitting is the first step
And 'ey, you know, ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But 'ey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, aiyyo, we made it, Thanksgiving
So 'ey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches??
Maybe, we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to for-get
After, all these these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, NOBODY
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, NOBODY

(WhooooooooOOOOOOOOOOoooooooOOOOOOOOOOooooooh..)

("Uh-huh, honey")

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Jerome's in the house, watch yo' mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch yo' mouth
Bound... ("Bound to fall in love")
Bound... ("Bound to fall in love")
("Uh-huh, honey")
