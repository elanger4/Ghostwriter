[Intro: Kanye West]
I need to call it off
I need to, I need to make it known
'Nother one, somethin gone, Capricorn
Dancin on, on the lawn
Fancy like, the things she likes
She lives her life
I'm living mine

[Chorus One: sample of Popcaan]
All dem a gwaan, dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gw-gw-gwaan, chop-chop-chop chop-chop
All dem a gwaan, dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Gwaan gwaan gw-gw-gwaan, chop it and spray

[Kanye West]
Maybe it's cause, she into Leos and I was into trios
Plus all the trips to Rio - couldn't have helped
It's gettin cold, better bring your ski clothes
Pick it through the keyhole - the door locked by myself
... And I'm feelin it right now
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little, champagne, cranberry, vodka
Feelin lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothin is a, +Shaka+
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new, Shabba!
She lookin for her daddy, call me Big, Poppa
... On to the next, saga
Focus on the future and let the crew, knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin Chew-bacca
The one Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka
Ohhhhh

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Two: sample of Popcaan]
All dem a gwaan, dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gw-gw-gwaan, chop-chop-chop chop-chop
None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray
None ah dem have the guts to bust the SK {*echoes*}

[Kid Cudi]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
If you love me so much then why'd you let me goooooo? Whoa whoa
Let me goooooo whoa whoa, let me goooooo whoa whoa
Let me go whoa whoa whoa whoa, hmmm
If you love me so much then why'd you let me goooooo? Whoa whoa
Let me go whoa whoa whoa whoa, hmm

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]
