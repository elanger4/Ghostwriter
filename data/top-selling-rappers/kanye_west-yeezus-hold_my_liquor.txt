[Justin Vernon]
I can't hold my liquor
Well this man can't handle his weed
Dark {?} rolling now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

[Chief Keef]
I cain't handle no liquor
But these bitches cain't handle me
I cain't control my niggaz
And my niggaz they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me
(-me, -me, -me, -me, -me, -ME, -ME)

[Kanye West]
Bitch I'm back out my coma
Wakin up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratched your Corolla
Okay I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I could own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call Tupac over
Yeezy's all in yo' sofa
These the red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
They love me when I ain't sober
They love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch wit no shoulders
Tellin you that I'm bogus
Bitch, you don't even know us!
Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner
Late night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that, he's just hopeless
Soulmates become soulless
When it's over, it's over
and bitch, I'm back out my coma!

[Justin Vernon]
Callin up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh, I'll phone home

[Chief Keef]
I cain't handle no liquor
But these bitches cain't handle me
I cain't control my niggaz
And my niggaz they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Justin Vernon] (West)
I heard you need a new fad (a new fad)
I heard you need a new stack (a new stack)
I heard you need a new phone (a new phone)
I know your 'rents ain't be home (a new)
Callin up your uncle's place (oh no, ah no)
Shit's all over the place (Oh, no, ohh)
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh, on the phone, 'one
