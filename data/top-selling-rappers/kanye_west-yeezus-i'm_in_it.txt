[Kanye West]
Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bath water on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin, bitin ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eatin ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin, I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce!
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

[Assassin]
That's all dem can do, say wah! (say wah!)
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting, just a badman ting
A dat man do
Action ting, yo a badman ting

I'm a badman if you know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way Jose
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's hard, couldn't try that no day
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh botha feel say we won't spray, like a aerosol can
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh botha feel say we won't spray, like an aerosol can
We a gon' smile 'pon court day
Cause we beat murder charge like O.J.

[Kanye West] + (Justin Vernon)
That's right I'm in it (should've known I would fall)
I'm in it (steppin on tacks on the floor)
That's right (and, boys at your door)
That's right I'm in it (well you need to fight for your own)
That's right I'm in it (then don't let me at your table)
I'm in it (if you just gonna lay there)
That's right (fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars)
(I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes)

[Kanye West]
Uhh, picked up where we left off
Uhh, I need you home when I get off
Uhh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uhh, I know you need that reptile
Uhh, she cut from a different textile
Uhh, she love different kinds of sex now
Uhh, black girl sippin white wine
Put my fist in her like the Civil Rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!

[Kanye West] + (Assassin)
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
(That's all dem can do, say wah - say wah!)
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
(That's all dem can do)
(We deal with action ting, just a badman ting)
(A dat man do)
That's right I'm in it

[Justin Vernon]
I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes
Say you long for me, for you
Lay it off with all your rules
Star, fucker
Star, fucker
Star, fucker
Who? Where?

[Kanye West]
Time to take it too far now
Uhh, Michael Douglas out the car now
Uhh, got the kids-and-the-wife life
Uhh, but can't wake up from the night life
Uhh, I'm so scared of my demons
Uhh, I go to sleep with a nightlight
Uhh, my mind move like a Tron bike
Uhh, pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uhh, I'm finna start a new movement
Uhh, bein led by the drums
Uhh, I'm a rap-lic priest
Uhh, gettin head by the nuns
Uhh, they don't play what I'm playin
Uhh, they don't see what I'm sayin
Uhh, they be ballin in the D-League
Uhh, I be speakin Swag-hili
