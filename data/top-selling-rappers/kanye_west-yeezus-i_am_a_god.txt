[Kanye West]
I am a god...
I am a god...
{I AM A GOD}

I am a god 
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn m√©nage 
Get the Porshe out the damn garage
I am a god 
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin with God

Soon as they like you, make 'em unlike you
cause kissin people ass is so unlike you
The ONLY rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin-ass niggaz to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggaz to bite you
I don't even wanna hear about, what niggaz might do
Old niggaz mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans, they ain't NEVER like you
Pink-ass Polos with a FUCKIN backpack
But err'body know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man WE the Rat Pack
Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn Diamond, Chi-Town shining
Monop' in this bitch again, change the climate
Hop in this bitch again, same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning...

I am a god 
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
HURRY UP WITH MY DAMN CROSSANTS!
I am a god...
I am a god...
{I AM A GOD}

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
AHHHHHHHHHHH-, -HHHHH, -HHHH, -HHHH!!!!

I just talked to Jesus
He said, "Waddup, Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit, I'm chillin
Tryna stack these millions"
I know He the Most High
But I am the close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's our Cosa Nostra, HAH!

I am a god...
I am a god...
{I AM A GOD}

AHH- AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
{*running and gasping*}

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
{*running and gasping*}

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
{*running and gasping loudly*}

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
{*running and gasping loudly*}

{Ain't no way I'm giving up, I'm a god}
