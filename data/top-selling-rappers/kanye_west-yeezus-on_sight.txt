[Kanye West]
Yeezy season approaching
Fuck whatever y'all been hearin
Fuck wha-, FUCK whatever y'all been wearin
A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shakin like Parkinson's
Take my number and lock it in
Indian head, no Moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Tims all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggaz off than Cochran, huh!
On sight... on sight!...

How much do you wanna give a fuck?
Lemme show you right now 'fore you give it up
How much do I not give fuck?
Lemme show you right now 'fore you give it up

{"Cause He'll give us what we need
  It may not be what we want"}

[Kanye West]
Baby girl try and get a nut
And her girl try and give it up
Chopped 'em both down
Don't +judge+ 'em, Joe Brown
One last announcment
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin
Err'body wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mooooooooouth, hah!
On sight... on sight!...

[Outro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Right now, I need right now
Right now, I need, I need, right now
Right now, I need, I need, right now
