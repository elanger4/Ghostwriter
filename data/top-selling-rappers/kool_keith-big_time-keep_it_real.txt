[Intro: Kool Keith]
Yo whassup?  This is Kool Keith (yea)
First of all I'd like to say, the industry is wak (wak)
That's right, I said it, the industry is wak (wak)
Everybody wak
I'm tired of this, let's do this
Yeah, check it out

[Kool Keith]
I'm hearin jokes, freestyled, they jam is wak
but representin my scrotum I show dem punks how to do this
Like Brutus I'm raw, sissies think they hardcore
Ass-out-hole-cold, kid freeze your rectum
Don't step to me with hip-hop, pop as Michael Jackson
Your crew is no threat, your style just a small fraction
So get up, lick the nuts, catch the hiccups
Your two-man crew, add one, makin doo-doo
You got your fans souped up, people drinkin urine
I'm mysterious plus your girl begs for anal sex
I got my tape butt-naked, pumpin Ricki Lake
Dogstyle champ, you pause at B, watch your crack shake
I got no time for toys and cheap steaks
Sat {?} with Texas niggaz, my crew down to pull triggers
Yo tell Ray to spin the record, take the sawed-off shotty
I call direct to jail, speak to John Gotti
Yo niggaz out here is jockin hard on his balls
Yo my flow just drop like Niagara Falls

[Chorus: Kool Keith]
keep it real - represent what?  My nut!
Keep it real - represent what?  My nut!
Keep it real - represent what?  My nut!
