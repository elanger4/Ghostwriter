[Keith:] A demented man !

[Tim:]   Yeah !

[Tim:]   Yeah !
[Keith:] Spittin in your fuckin eyes...no face !

[Tim:]
Hey yo I catch mad break, and muthapukkaz always get respect
coz I'm off for putting TECs to their neck
You can walk around your block, at your pizza's, at your mom's, at your pop's
When I lick shots even cops give me props
coz I slay, yeah I slay all my victims
Niggaz see me coming and they say "don't fuck with him"
That nigga from New York, you know he gets bigger
Uptown trouble maker, rap Bronx nigga
Yeah ! What's my fuckin name ? Tim Diggety !
Niggaz see me comin and they all start running for the border
Outta order, they're being slaughtered
I'm deadly with the rhyme and the fuckin tape recorder
coz I can kill at will MCs without a touch
and you female rappers, with my words: you'll get fucked
Stuck. Outta luck. Closed case 
Destroyed by the man with no face
Listen

[Chorus:]
No face ! [Keith: No fuckin face]
No face ! [Keith: He gots no fuckin face]
No face ! [Keith: The man with no fuckin face]

Yo let me take you on a journey
about this punk nigga of the block sellin rocks to the cops
How I knocked the mutha's poops out
Frontin on my moms in the fuckin elevator
"lend me five dollars and I'll pay you back later"
Greater. My moms said no and held her purse
Hit her in the head, now my moms need a nurse
The worst thing you could do was touch my lady
The one who gave me life, yo nigga, is you crazy ?
I'm swayze, ran out the crib with my mac
to TEC the fowl down, hell no, he's not a jack
It's strictly homocide on my muthaphukkin (??????)
You dis me, I kill you, it's all that simple
Now as I turn the corner who the fuck did I see ?
The same bitch nigga starin right at me
He reached, I reached, I beat him to the punch
Now he's in the gutter and he's fuckin pigeon lunch
The cops came around but they had no case
The witnesses said it was a man with no face

[CHORUS:]
No face ! [Keith: No fuckin face]
No face ! [Keith: The muthaphukka's got no face] 
No face ! [Keith: No fuckin face]
No face ! [Keith: No face]
No face ! [Keith: No fuckin goddamn face]
No face ! [Keith: He got no fuckin face]
No face ! [Keith: No damn face]
No face !

[Keith:] 
Yo, the legacy continues, all you fake muthaphukkaz bein
