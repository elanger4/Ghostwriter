[girl:] Oh it's such a big mic, a beautiful mic. Who rocks the mic ?

[CHORUS:]

[Who rocks the mic, who rocks the mic right] Yeah !
[Who can keep it tight every goddamn night, baby] Yeah !
The D-O-G, that's me
Gotta stay hard on the M-I-C

[Who rocks the mic, who rocks the mic right] Yeah !
[Who can keep it tight every goddamn night, baby] 
The D-O-G, that's me
You know how I goes deep with this M-I-C

I grew up on the wildside, stress !
Bullet proof vest so instate on my chest
In the projects, South Bronx bound where it went down
Whenever the brothers rap, yo you know I gotta get down
sit down, check out this lyrical massageness
Metaphored phrases so the suckaz can't follow it
Don't bite it, just taste it
My rhymes you won't waste it
You chew it like it's gum
coz I know you want some
of the delicious, bubbleicious
lyrical expeditious
ways that I display that I'm gettin all the kisses
like I'm Hershey, the worst, G
is think that you can hurt me
I shot my A&R coz the sucha tried to jerk me
Who rocks?

[CHORUS:]

[Who rocks the mic, who rocks the mic right] Yeah !
[Who can keep it tight every goddamn night, baby] Yeah !
The D-O-G, that's me
You know I gotta hit you with this M-I-C

[Who rocks the mic, who rocks the mic right] Yeah !
[Who can keep it tight every goddamn night, baby] 
The D-O-G, that's me
You know I go up in with this M-I-C

[The way you do me baby, rock me all night long]
[Come give it to me, boy, you've got it going on]
[The way you do me, rock me all night long]
[You are the one for me]

I tie a rope around my neck
jump off a 50 ft deck
before a rapper think he's gonna disrespect
I come correct
South Bronx nigga from the projects
Home of the free cheese and welfare checks
I snap necks
They call me Van Damme with my hands
I'm the man in case the delyricists don't even understand who I am
The Dog I rip the track like I'm Shaq
so get back before you stick yourself like pretty Tony and the mac
These rappers are wack
but I can never fall or fumble
Just coz I'm Dog doesn't mean I ain't humble
I smash, crash MCs and keep my raps hype
Hey yo, Bull, tell'em who rocks the mic, Aight

[CHORUS:]

[Who rocks the mic, who rocks the mic right] Yeah !
[Who can keep it tight every goddamn night, baby] Yeah !
The D-O-G, that's me
You know how I do on this M-I-C

[Who rocks the mic, who rocks the mic right] Yeah !
[Who can keep it tight every goddamn night, baby] 
The D-O-G, that's me
I gotta put it down on the M-I-C

[The way you do me baby, rock me all night long]
[Come give it to me, boy, you've got it going on]
[The way you do me, rock me all night long]
[You are the one for me]

[The way you do me baby, rock me all night long]
[Come give it to me, boy, you've got it going on]
[The way you do me, rock me all night long]
[You are the one for me]
