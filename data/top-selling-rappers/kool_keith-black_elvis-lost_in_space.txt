[*Black Elvis*]
Blast full at ten, Keith still solo with no manager
Time clock out, studios, need to block out
Here's my number call me direct, get no feedback
No interviews, channel four, see me on the news
Erase your message walk streets with my cellular phone
Address you wonder, don't try to catch me home alone
Up seven o'clock, while you trying to find me on my block
I'm at the airport, you think I'm strange, boardin the plane
Turn off my pager, then quickly, relax my feet
Hotel Onion drinkin brew watchin Sesame Street
You thought you saw me with a wig on, at 7/11
Disguised like Shakespeare with blue chrome behind your ear
My George Washington robe, I still travel the globe
On Pan-Am airflights, I roll in cities after midnight
Stand in your lobby unsuspected, you get neglected
Traffic was hectic..

[*Black Elvis*]
Order room service, transfer quick to Holiday Inn
Check out time nine o'clock, coat on, I'm on again
You comin so wack you sound like the _Bulworth_ soundtrack
I'm in the mall steady shoppin while you tryin to call
It's on my answering machine, to speak to me as a dream
Pacific Bell know him, the phone is off, and I'm well known
1-800 number, castle code see to summer
Extreme complicated businessman, can't be reached
No type of headquarters, deserted land, by the waters
Target my focus on, internal thinkin by myself
You catch the treatments hiatus like Sam on the shelf
Move out your zip code with U-Haul, watch you fall
Obtain five boxes callin Mayflower, every hour
You scratch your brain askin neighbors what, now you wonder

[*Black Elvis*]
While you search lookin deep in your Rolodex, I flex, I tell the truth
When I'm serious you think I'm mysterious, drop rap in minutes
Become your problem like Dennis the Menace
Hold up your meetings papi, let's ? to the papparazzi
Unseen heard of your magazine got the nerve of a two-year old crayon writing
Talkin to y'all I'm decidin
Communication leads one step to aggravation
I got my ears closed, back to bookin my own shoes

Level seven eight nine - second dimension
