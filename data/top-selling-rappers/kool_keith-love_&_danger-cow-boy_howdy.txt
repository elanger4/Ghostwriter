[Kool Keith]
Cowboy howdy, cowboy howdy!
Cowboy howdy {*6X*}
Cowboy

A real brolic champ, won't teach 'em how to rap
That sweat, that moveback, prove that, you whack
Open session, give 'em that lesson
Salad with the dressing - they can't
stop this, rock this, ar-tist
I sound Scottish, British, listen
You can't handle scramble Sambo
Atlanta, Georgia how's that for ya?
Numbers where, didn't that bore ya?
Teach you to rap, how to play pitty pat pat pat pat
Wires tapped, while you rap
everything buttcrack, I'm top crack
Down South flusher, up North rusher
Clear my lane, let me dunk
Clear my lane, let me jump
Agizzle Cousette{?}
Agizzle to your jet
It's like the Double Dutch Bus, you can crush
Volume turner, earner learner
You get taught, conscious caught
Stay out my face~! I run this sport (BOY)

[Chorus: Kool Keith]
The cowboys in session {*2X*}
The cowboys in session {*2X*}
The cowboys in session {*2X*}

[Mr. Sche]
Cowboy howdy, cowboy salute
Cowboy spurs, cowboy boots
Cowboy pose, cowboy loot
Sure can't catch me cowboy stupid
Itchy itchy itchy I've got ants in my boots
I've got lasers in my eyes, and my lasers can shoot
Wow! Big ol' circle
Big ol' boot these jerkos
Flashy pink and purple
Everybody clap your hands
Do the cowboy dance
I got holes in my pants
Denim, Wrangler, Levi
Keep that mud off my boots
Missiles in my hair
I see demons in the air
It's the story of my life
We go, we don't care {*4X*}
We go... take it slow
Watch that cowboy go
Cowboy love that bar room show {*2X*}
An idea's, forced at me{?}
Cowboy love that bar room show {*3X*}

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Cowboy howdy {*6X*}
Cowboy
