[Kool Keith]
This is a song that you won't mix again
(NUMBER ONE!!!) Number one song {*THUNDER*}
Take you by storm... {*echoes*}

And you love that, and you love that {*3X*}
Baby....
And you love that
And you lo-ove... {*2X*}

Momma Go-rill', that's the ani-mill
Horse hay/hey get out the way, shake it like ShayShay
Dimepiece let yourself go NeNe; wrinkle terror
I tell you like Grandma, you look bad Sarah
This new generation, come look at your era
Pigs feet and stomach diva - Butterball turkey belly
You can't fix your bra CiCi
Stretch your legs and (BABY)
You can't put on your denim
So good I lace you with that Dannon yogurt
Lace you (lace)

And you love that, and you love that {*4X*}

Spanish food, gastric juice
Maritza get off the douche
Rhino baby, no blanket cover your lady
I spot the cyclop roadblock that holds lox
Five fish in your fist
Men settle out for desparate polar bears
React website chit-chat
Girdles come out for Bronx Zoo snatch, with chin fat
True Religion on XX dimes rubbed together
Lane Bryant support, no heartburn
She can't breathe at the food court
Text no talk, whales need sport
And you love thaaaaaaaaat
And you looooove that
And you love that {*5X*}
Love love
And you love you love you love you love you love
You love that
Love, love that
Love, love, love
Love, love, love
