[Kool Keith]
The D to the N, the N to the A
It's the DNA soul, two o'clock PM
Hexagonal hangs love, to move on above
Dave Eggers on the side, of course right beside
Mr. Cee to agree to my philosophy
As the chairman of the board of high society
On the mic I'll deliver, make your brain quiver
Yes the man Keith Keith, known to top chief
By dividing up a rhyme, approximate the time
With arhythmatic to work, to solve and achieve
For example as a guide, from me you'll receive
This phenomenon to add, mentally I'm mad
As I show the blind student, correct and more prudent
That his mind is North bound, confused and South bound
Heading West, back East, in curve with a beast
Of zodiac acryllic, or should I be Pacific
My perfection on the mic, 12 years and terrific
So you better listen up, step and take a seat
Bop your head, snap your fingers and dance to the beat
Kool Keith

[Ced Gee]
Now as you look at your hands, go around the clock
Yes the Jam 105, is your last stop
With RPM and Money D, will slice the amp up see
With Hank Love mixin, the Master Cee is drippin
When Zach is on time, you're musically inclined
To a fusion of relief, hydrogen and gases
Triggered with atoms, formin in the masses
Enlargin to control as a rockin parasite
With ambition to destroy, all toys who wanna bite
Like a rapper on stage, convincing you to stay
With a bundle to recundle, yes the stars gaze
To be articulate, joyful and exuberant
Related by me and that you best believe
Ced Gee! Aww yeah, and that was somethin special
