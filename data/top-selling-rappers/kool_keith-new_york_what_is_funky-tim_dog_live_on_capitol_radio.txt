Yeah, all that, don't just start right with the beat
Play that there, da-da, da-da, da-da
Yeah cause you can do your ID, you can do your ID right there

[Tim Dog]
Yeah, this is Tim Dog on the Tim Westwood show
Chorus Line leader #1
And I'ma start it off like this, aight?
I want y'all to turn your box up, and just put it on record
Yeah, like this

Roll the dice, craps, hot damn
I'm not who you think I am
I don't need a cane, cause I don't limp
Tim Dog's a pimp, and not a wimp
He's a subject matter, without the chit chatter
You're lookin at a, brother that's badder
So manifest guest the rest is blessed
Put up a test - I watch your skinny ass 'fess
I'm the man and all girls love me
Sucker rappers try to be above me
You wanna play me like I oughta be taught?
Remember, Tim Dog ain't takin no shorts
I wanna get mine, and you get yours
And just cause your girl wanna give me some drawers
Don't get mad, try to give me some static
My posse is thick (thick) and it's automatic
With TR Love bringin up the nine
Kool Keith, comin right behind
And Ced Gee with the nine of course
And suckers out there don't even know the source
Tim Dog, hypo, nitro
And I'ma just go, and let the rhythm flow
My bass will get'cha, my rhymes will wilt ya
So sit your ass down 'fore I backslap your bitch up
My rhymes will go, and just flow
And I won't even front on the tempo
I'm the Chorus Line leader #1
And I will rise with the moon and go down with sun
And my rhymes, are cocaine
Good for the brain, but drives you insane
You get hyper, you wanna get riper
But with Tim Dog it's just not that type of night
So just ready to write
Recite and recite, but just don't bite
I break ass and smack glass you're full of flash
And you try to go, you're like dash
away, in the lobby, in the alley
Tim Dog wit'cha, beef code rally
I'm like an Indianapolis
And I'm out the metro-politician, I'm dissin
My rhymes is mistin
And I'm end it at all cause I'm kissin
Yo, this is Tim Dog, with my man Tim Westwood
On Capitol Radio
And for y'all the rap fans out there
hardcore rap RULES!  Believe that
