[Tim Dog]
Ahhh shit, well I'll be God damned
The life that I live is not of mortal man
Pursuin my righteous, hype just, might just get
another chance to uphold my lightning
Peace, now at the least
I'll crush a motherfucker that gives me beef
I'm the hardcore master, one that has ta
cruise right past ya remain disaster
So step - what the fuck you got beef for
You fuckin with me for, a kid on a see-saw
The man in hand that sass the clan the motherland
So what's your damn problem man?
Comprehend and then, if you still pretend
That your rhymes will win, I will fuck your girlfriend
Again, and again and again, and again
And when the pussy is sore, I will fuck her again
In the back door, in other words her black ass
I send her home for sex ed class
She ain't shit, she can't even fuck
She had the nerve to not even suck
my dick, yeah she's gotta be sick
I threw her out my house real quick
I'm a bitch molester, an Uncle Fester
The one to lust for, caress and test-a
So I suggest-a, when you address
to grab a titty palm her ass, cause I done left her
Forget her, cause Tim Dog is large
Dog's a motherfuckin Benz garage
I'm a Porsche Audi, like John Gotti
I like to party but what's up with the body
I'm a sex fiend, won't jerk off or masturbate
As long as pussy I hear, I'm straight
I'ma fuck and fuck, and fuck and fuck
Then fuck and fuck, then I fuck and fuck
Then I fuck and fuck, then I fuck and fuck
And what I'm doin after that?  I'ma still fuck
So Ced Gee, you know you're next in line
Yo, take the mic and bust a dope-ass rhyme

[Ced Gee]
One two one two one more goes like this
False alarm - you ain't seen no smoke
The smoke you're seein, is there cause I broke
down the rhyme a vicious kind to feed your mind
The warning sign, and then recline
Down, and rhyme when the pace kicks
Up up a hundred, yo I gotta get
a mic and get hyper, cause I can recite the
lyrics to flip the crowd, just like Pied Pipers
Music, I won't abuse it, nor misuse it
Just add some flavor to it yo and prove it
Just like that new car, with mileage it go far
You'll see the best Ced Gee I'm an Ultra star
Galactic, Galactus, fantastic
Brass trick, practice, yeah
You understand what I'm sayin?  Yo bust it
I'll control uphold the show
From beginnin to intro, Ced Gee is like nitro-glyc'
And I will diss, those who insist
on bustin their weak rhymes, Ced Gee will just piss
my urine right on you, strut then transform you
Hold you and mold you, rip you and fold you
Duck, so what the fuck, you out of luck
You rhyme like a Jetta while I rhyme like a Mack truck
Rollin hard with eighteen wheels and all
With the mic, so I must call
myself a leader, a whack rap deleter
The feeder who needs the, crowd to procede the
whole 9 yards as well as the distance
I'm Ced Gee, and I represent
All who want the call, leave their boy in awe
Who wants to be adored, Tim Dog - my mellow my man

[voice]
No, it's Jam Rock's turn
Jam, you ready Jam?
