"This shit is bananas!"

Let's go! (Let's go) Yeah! YEAH~!
Let's go, Kool Keith gon' get at you (let's go)
Ha hahh! (let's go)

[Kool Keith]
Strong format, girls on the doormat
We work it work it, they jerk it jerk it
We comin on, ya fail, with manny or mayo
Girl with the boobs out, white potatoes
Let me squeeze tomatoes, pie lemon Loradoes
Eight-oh-eight-oh-eight-oh's
DJ's spin they plate-oh's, ladies jump - get fatal
People say we don't play though, I'm a angel with halos
Play bass, ba-bum, ba-bum-ba-BUM-BUM

Shake your bum-bum {*repeat 4X*}

Verse, verse, one one
Verse, verse, two two
Come and a grab a boo-hoo, Cognac and Yoohoo
Crowd on the side gettin bumped and they sippin brew
Bronx crew come through beat you, stomp you
People come and rock you, nobody guard to block you
Fans come sock you, heads just bop to
Girls give me brain-brain, move on the thang-thang
Sparkles on the chain gang, booty target nice aim
Big butt, nice frame, you got to move off the highway
Man get out my lane
Old man get out they cane, thongs and bras remains
Thongs and bras REMAIN~!

Shake your bum-bum {*repeat 4X*}

Ladies get sexy, come in coat check see
You catch epilepsy, rum'n'Coke'n'Pepsi
Baby you respect me, fur coat you bet me
Keith like Sweat be, first class jet see
Girls on X-ee, paper to paper
Caper to caper, like Johnny Taylor said
It's cheaper to keep herrrrrrrr

Shake your bum-bum {*repeat 8X*}
