That's how it's goin down (uh-huh)
Ultramag (yeah bring it baby) Ced Gee (let's do this)
Feel me (get it poppin now)

Uncork the champagne, dawg let's get it poppin
Boy it's a lot of stars up in here tonight
But we the ones that's gon' get it rockin
You know how we make moves, when all the hits start droppin
We get it live up in here, everybody heads boppin
All the cornball cats, is clockin
Watchin what we do, so they can learn how to make moves
They copyin us line for line, that's what the fake cats do
While all my live niggaz, just makin they own moves
They doin it big, they doin it right
They spared no expenses son, they gon' shine tonight
Aight? Yeah

[Chorus]
Let's get this party started (uh-huh, okay)
Yeah! Let's get this party started (I'm ready, let's go)
Let's get this party started (uh-huh, okay)
Yeah! Let's get this party started (I'm ready, let's go c'mon, let's go)

[Kool Keith]
I'm the wine sipper
The in the cut man to zip down her zipper
The verse and bra flipper she shakes the cakes RIGHT
She shakes the cakes LEFT
Like that company down South I'm +SoSoDef+
In the reclining chair, I love what I wear
Excite the ladies with dye in they hair
The coyote or minky? Y'all sport bear
Hangin with me it's like the Cosmo's Fair
Find that greatest MC like me, it's very rare
They stop and the sun in they eyes, football field glare
900 a minute, big bill tear
Big bill scare, yeah

[Chorus]

[Kool Keith]
The seltzer sit, the glass bubble
Mess with the thongs, all the ladies get over there in a huddle
The juicy toucher, she flash her D-cuppah
I like the melons for supper
The whole colossal picture, they call me Mister
The record presser, Vanessa we undress her

[Ced Gee]
Uh-huh, son you partyin with the right ones
The hype ones, the bright ones
We about to get it poppin up in here dawg
You better keep it tight son
Stay with me, cause this is goin down tonight son
All the mas is lookin right son
And they givin it up so nice son
Do what you like son, feel me? Yeah

[Chorus]
