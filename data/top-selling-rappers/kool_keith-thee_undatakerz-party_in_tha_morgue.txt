Song:   Party in Tha Morgue
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

C'mon, like that y'all
C'mon, like that y'all

(Party in the morgue) like that y'all
(Party in the morgue) like that y'all
C'mon (Party in the morgue) like that y'all
C'mon (Party in the morgue) like that y'all

[Chorus]
C'mon, party in the morgue, party in the morgue
C'mon, party in the morgue (like that y'all) party in the morgue yeah
C'mon, party in the morgue, party in the morgue
C'mon, party in the morgue y'all - YEAH!  Party in the morgue

[Verse One: Reverand Tom - Kool Keith]
Women know the flame, I can't shame your fame
We bought the bottles, club bring in the reign
Don Don of Pino, bottle up first
Call Vegas casino, the top cat with the dark blue Cadillac
Up to Reno from there
Hit the Filipino, let her roll, get bold, reload
First name Gino, Valentino
Take her to the patio, park the spot, slut you're hot
You're nothin you're not, leavin the spot
That's right yo, what is not when we come to come through
When you want to, that's when he touched you
Touched two, touched three touched for and
See the score and we pourin
With Johnny Donny in a Mazeratti
Slick Rick playin "La-Di-Da-Di"
Yeah, that's right yo, that's right yo.. {*echoes and fades*}

  Let me see you say ho!
  It's a party in the morgue, Bronx Brooklyn style!
  
[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Thee Undatakerz]
New Jersey in the house, Philly cats on me
The {?} high rock, smokin blunts of green
Miami hoes in the house, G-strings and thongs
Chicago pimps get paid when the record's on
Rough - see me do my thing
We're Detroit boss players with them pinky ringers
Rinky-dink cheap whores without chips ain't jack
See the roof is on fire and the party is packed
Shake and bake and take the time to make a rhyme
that penetrate straight through your mind

[Verse Three: M-Balmer]
Up in the morgue, jump in the hottub and get a backrub
Surrounded by some bad niggaz and a pound of bombudd
They like my love, that's all I'm thinkin of
Give it to me now, here we go, put 'em under
Somehow I make it thunder
Shake my back and then they wonder
Sippin on Cristal, slidin through the morgue
They hear me cumin...
Who be the richest, the gist is
M-Balmer the {?} mistress
Y'all know y'all wanna hit this!
I'll be makin all the noise
Now follow me boys!

[Chorus] - repeat to fade at least 4X
