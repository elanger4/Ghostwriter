Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash

[Rev. Tom] I'm here with the Funeral Director
[Fun. Dir] Mmmm-hmm
[Rev. Tom] He wants to tell people about, a lot of his records
[Fun. Dir] Mmmm-hmm!
[Rev. Tom] And the way he conducts his, churchs and stuff like that

[The Funeral Director]
I bury bodies
I stick catheters, in their chest cavities
I keep things moving
I don't mind burying, I don't mind undertaking
Yes I will be your Funeral, Director
The Funeral Director
The Funeral Director

[Thee Undatakerz]
See I walk the urban streets
Bloodthirsty with spit drippin from my teeth
Black werewolf on the loose chewin ligaments
Only human without no beef
My next victim just might be you
The Undatakerz, East West coast bodybaggers
Draggin bodies up and down the block around the clock
before the doc, toe tag 'em
Funeral Director slash bodies, leave 'em cut up in a blender
Whether it's John or Brenda, Sal or Glenda
Anybody corpse we dismember
See God made me this way, gave me this distemper
I was born with the intent to kill
Feelin no emotion when the body drops
Actually the, sight of death, just might make me thrill
I love to watch flesh peel
Take the picture of you when you take yo' last breath
Tryin to gasp for more air without no energy left
Orderlies move for death
Let your life go, let your life go, breathe slow
Let your life go, breathe slow
Let your life go, breathe slow
Just let your life go and breathe slow

[The Funeral Director]
I will bury you
I have no problem, with putting you in the ground
Pulling up my truck, putting your casket... inside, my hearse
Driving it up, to the graveyard

[M-Balmer]
M-Balmer got a style that is versatile
Blowin up the room, make the crowd go wild
So have a smoke, not a cap
Now who not not not not not now
Let's see how many MC's jock my flow
Two thousand and ten, I'll be a legend though
Still keepin up the flow
Fluid runnin through my soul, make me grow
Cause I'm instructable and I'm invincible

[The Funeral Director]
We have, platinum coffins, to put you in
You can believe, you will not, be coming back
Ha, ha ha, hahahahaha
Ah-hahahahahahaha
Ah-ahahahahahahaha
Ah-ahahahahahahahahahahaha
Ahhh..
