[Lil Wayne]
I'm in the crib butt naked bitch
She said my dick could be the next black President
Americans hate that I'm American
Medicine, I treat it like peppermints
Uhh! I'm in the ocean gettin shark pussy
Shoot you in your fuckin mouth and make you talk to me
Sometimes I need someone to talk to
cause "I Am Not a Human Being - Part II"
Gettin paid, show money for walkthroughs
Lettin all these hoes ride my dick, car pool
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds
Uhh - what'cha man doin?
I pop his motherfuckin top like a canned good
And all my niggaz that I roll with are hella armed
And last night I took a Transformer
and had a dream that my dick turned to Megatron
But my girl, was sleepin with Decepticons
Money talks, man and mine talks lecture long
P-U-S-S-Y, my second home
I be grindin on them hoes like a half pipe
She say "Tunechi you the shit, you need your ass wiped"
I said "Before you gas me up, check the gas price"
Then I make her take this dick like advice, hehe
She see-saw it, she suck it and enjoy it
I stick it in her ass like some fuckin steroids
Jose Canseco, make no mistake-o
like a white boy wearin black paint you're a fake ass nigga
Break pads nigga - wait
{You ain't in my weight class nigga}
Lookin for the motherfuckin man in the mirror
Runnin this shit like a +Fawcett, Farrah+, barra-cuda
Who the fuck you are?
I can make your bitch root for me like I grew her
Bodies in the sewer tampons in manure
90 billions bitches on my stick like a skewer
That's swag, I'm a +True Blood+, bitch no fangs
Been went pro, now I'm goin propane
Tell the bitch get off me, bitch get off me
I got her over here blowin me like coffee; decaffinated
Hand me that paper like I graduated
And I get head while it's decapitated
Hehe; think it's a game nigga come play
I'm with my killer bees; fuck bug spray
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta
I personally know strangers
It's so strange but this girl named Dana, like to go anal
Shoot 'em in his head, what's that? No brainer
Plain ol' nigga, but a break from the norm
I wear my heart on my sleeve so don't be breakin my arm
I rather ring your fuckin neck before I ring the alarm
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me along - with him
I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair
Fuck with me, your ass is grass, get a lawn chair
I was fuckin before my dick started growin hair
Bitches sweatin me like John Mayer, or warm air
Mannnn, nuts and bananas~!!
You know how the tables turn where are yo' table manners?
If you fake, put a egg in yo' shoe and scramble
No rubber; I just fucked this piano - nigga!!
Look, do you

[Outro]
Turn it up
Yeah, hello world
As I always say
I, am not, a human being... TWO
