[Intro]
Raj Smooth, the greatest DJ in the world
Yes! We about to say a prayer for all our loved ones
(I'm a call this one real rap)
Anybody you lost put them on yo heart
cause this rap is real, light it up for 'em
Ya Know
I hope you ain't to tired to cry
And I hope you know you ain't never to live to die

[Lil Wayne]
Listen
I grew up where them people call them people on us
Think we slangin but we just got beepers on us
Grinding all day like we got sleep insomnia
Living like the videos write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they poured cement on us
Ghetto bird still shitin on us
Government still quitting on us
Lost a few homies and the grief's still sitting on us
So we got they names written on us
White folks still spitting on us
And them bitch ass police k9's teeth still gritting on us
But we smoke ashes still getting on us
Older bitches still hitting on us
I remember well
BZ rolled a L, BZ ain't here
Where's BZ at? BZ got killed
And that was my nigga
I go way back with my nigga
But I know that's how it happened my nigga
Shit is much deeper then this rapping, My nigga
But know they all rappin, My niggas
So now I must make it happen
So I'm a play the captain
Sail boat flapping
My nigga
No fingers I'm snapping
Happy for my nigga lil Tagus
Cause even though we couldnt
The lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Shhh found his body like a month later
Rest in peace boy
He was a east boy
And so was Wessy West
He was a good nigga so I know he bless
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But let me keep going
But I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'm a keep on pumping the flow
So if I cry don't stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped the beat
My nigga lil Derek was quick to cop a key
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that
He's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family in his momma's fine
So much shit, just sit on this mind to mine
I think about it all the time
I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
Cause if my thoughts got to me I'd be in this rap
Or I'll be in a can
Thank god I had dreams of being a man
Yeah
And fuck a man with a badge
Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The 5-0 killed Naudy, the good boy dead
Man you would've thought they killed cornbread
Shot him up face down on the lawn
Not to mention wit his handcuffs on
Not to mention they had plain clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But nobody do nothing about it
The jail house and the morgue is to fucking crowded
And hate is at an all time high
Everybody gotta hater like a fucking ipod
Shit and they tried to burn my Phantom up
But I got my gun licenses
I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a ca-me-ra
Stay still motherfucker
I'm a have to write my will this summer
Cause if they don't kill me
I'm a kill this summer
Yea
And you can put that on my late father
Or my late grandmother, Miss Mercedes Carter
Or my grandfather Larry Balsock
The old man hustled till his heart stopped
And I know that my real pops had money
No bank account that brown paper bag money
Yea he might hit me off with a little brag money
But that nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out I hope he glad for me
But that's why when I see him I acts mad funny
Cause he a joke to me
Don't message, don't call
Don't talk to me
It's just me and my momma
How it suppose to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope from me
And I don't never wanna see her mope for me
Hopefully!
But Truthfully
There is a day that's due for me
But we gone pray that it's as far as the future sees
You are listening to the future Weezy F. Baby. Amen
