Ha ha~! Uhh
Man fuck them bitches, and them hoes
And them niggaz pussies, heh, camel toes
I got some money on me, and the weed nice
My shit won't ever stop, suck my green light
Bitch it's Carter IV, murder's all she wrote
Now it's fuck everybody, like a Scorpio
Still runnin shit, I'm on my cardio
Boy I'm goin in, like my water broke
Suicide note, suicide doors
I put in overtime, like a tied score
Tinted windows bitch, that mean mind yours
And the weed loud, like a lion's roar
Stare into the eyes, the eyes of forever
Hear no evil, see no evil - Helen Keller
No music on, rock it acapella
And I don't need a watch, the time is now or never
Tell my niggaz love, I die behind this shit
A nigga countin money, you niggaz counterfeit
Real nigga, nigga - proud of what I am
Young Money is an army, bitch I'm Uncle Sam
Them hoes call me Tunechi, mama call me Tune'
I left the bullshit, in the waitin room
Straight to the money, no short cuts
Now watch me go retarded, yellow short bus
We do drive-bys, we do walk-ups
and bitch I be so high, I get star struck
Millz in this bitch, he said fuck them hoes
And the jewelry bright, like summer clothes
And I keep some +Bud+, like Rudy Huxtable
I'm bout to slam the beat, nigga Dusty Rhodes
I'm from Eagle Street, I go Hercules
I get on the beat, murder first degree
Y.M.C.M.B., we don't give a fuck
You faker than some titties, you get tittie fucked
Ha~! This the best-worst feelin
And nigga if I die I die a death worth livin
Uhh... this that textbook G shit
I've been in that water but I've never been sea sick
Yeah, knock me I knock your face off
Life's a crazy bitch - Grace Jones
Mind of a genius, with a heart of stone
Ha! C4, Mr. Carter's home {*echoes*}
