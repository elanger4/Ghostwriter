Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume, consumes the flame
We'll burn it at both ends, it's safe to assume
What doesn't consume the flame, the flame consumes
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume, consumes the flame
Burn it on both ends, we're hoping and praying for rain

[Verse 1: Sage Francis]
Listen, a lie is just a lie if you believe that they'll believe it
Otherwise it's some sly legal speak so we keep our secrets
Our rap lineup in a silk robe
They prance around the home like princesses obsessed with kissing every toad
But ain't no prince here
In fact, I had to slay the dragon I was chasing for the warts to disappear
And dissect the frog, cut through the fog and do my thing
In the land of the pigs, the butcher is king
This is two-hundred and sixty pounds of ground meat in a town sound sleep
Countin' cards while they count sleep
Now I'm on a sacrificial lamb, it's collapsing an iron lung
Had to remove the mask and ask what kind of trash am I among
Caught in the widow's web the black spiders spun
Taking a beating so ancient that it's basically a tribal drum
I'm seeing stars and constellations
Seeing warning signals in the Universe's dashboard they're all saying

[Chorus]
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume, consumes the flame
We'll burn it at both ends, it's safe to assume
What doesn't consume the flame, the flame consumes
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume, consumes the flame
We'll burn it on both ends, we're hoping and praying for rain

[Verse 2]
Paint me like one of your French girls
Use my neck as a scratch poster, rip out every last one of them red curls
Knit me a sweater with the intestines of attention whores
Of no expectations of the tribe I'll have to settle for
Circular logic is foul talk, mental sex for sport
Abuse me like customer support (I'll be your tech support)
I'm sorry to hear you're having problems
It must be difficult, let me see if I can help you like--figure 'em out
Have you listened to Biz Markie's "Just a Friend"
Have you tried turning me off and back on again
If you Make-A-Wish on a foundation there's maintenance required
All I ask is you be careful when you state what you desire
They say Satan is on fire without breaking a sweat
All that pagan shit is tired so I'm taking a rest
I met my date at the pyre she was shorter than I like
But wore a dress that's as long as the night, then I saw the light

[Chorus]
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume, consumes the flame
We'll burn it at both ends, it's safe to assume
What doesn't consume the flame, the flame consumes
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume, consumes the flame
We'll burn it on both ends, we're hoping and praying for rain

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'd settle on a bed of rusty nails instead of roses
'Cause a song by any other name is so earnest, so forth
So what, I got blood on my mattress
Got a harem full of knife throwers who use my back for target practice
I fucks with them [?] types
Inherited this cutlery along with the scars, they all look alike
Used to write confessions in between the lines
And used to wear long sleeves so no one else could read my mind
Now I exercise my right to bear arms when I write words
The last polar bear taking a last stand on a melting iceberg
Where nothing is exclusiveâwhen holding confidence
Sex could get abusiveâbut everyone consents
Anything that's lucrativeâgets reduced to checks
And now you're wondering where your fair share of the bit of profit is
Sorry kids, the piggy banks depleted
Had a million dollar smile, but not the pretty face that's needed
I've seen torture
but I've never tapped a bottle or twisted the cap whenever they passed the forty
I'm fat boy disorderly nothing fun about obesity
But recently, I toyed with it morbidly
Cordially invite you to the incredible, mind that bends metal
No spoon is safe, no fork is too special
Essentially we all know how the story ends
How heavily the plot twist depends on a little bit of
Maintenance, maintenance, maintenance

[Outro]
My house bitches lololololololololol
