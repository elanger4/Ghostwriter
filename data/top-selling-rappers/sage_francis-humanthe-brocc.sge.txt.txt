That's dope
That's fresh
That's dope
That's fresh
That's dope
That's fresh
That's fresh

[man's voice]
"This is what broccoli is all about."

[woman's voice]
"And the way you boil broccoli, it's texture
and the green color is so wonderful... I'm simply amazed..
as a housewife right now ah hahah."

[man's voice]
"Why don't you serve this to president George Bush?
You know, he once told the press that he wasn't too crazy about broccoli
and it actually made the news!"

[woman's voice]
"I never imagined broccoli can be put together
with something sweet like this, and the yogurt is not so overpowering either."

[man's voice]
"I think he went to the extent of being a, well you could say
evangelist of broccoli, like an ambassador of sorts
That's his greatness, really."
