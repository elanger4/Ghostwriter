Song:   Three Sheets to the Wind
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Had one too many one way conversations
with the licky licky lord
'till I grew a scissor tongue
and c-c-cut the cord
put the phone on the floor
detach the wires in my head
took awhile to accept that that line was dead

[Chorus]
didn't never wanna not live forever [x3]
didn't never wanna not not wanna live

Nah, it didn't matter if the laughter didn't come after the bad joke
if I was down with the filthy rich or flat broke
accepted by the Aryans or black folk
cause I was carrying this weight until my back broke
wasn't trying to be no hip hop god or raps G.O.A.T.
shootin to be a rock star like its my last hope
Eyeballin that pack of smokes DO ME IN!
graduatin on the crack coke DO ME IN!
knocked of a paddle boat in the middle of the castle moat
kings men are yelling GRAB THE ROPE!

three sheets to the wind three!
three sheets to the wind!

i talk like a sailor, my mother is one
that's why I got this sixth sense of direction and my split tongue
taught me how to go with the flow when the winds come
curled up in a ball and tried to hide inside a kick drum
while the crew is gettin piss drunk I had to purify my own and drink up
i had to save and conserve recycle my salty words
to keep the meat on my bones all pres-s-s-served

[Chorus]

It was a tug of war and we all faught together
'till we went our own way when the c-c-c-cord was severed
The stormy weather would begin, we'd all sucumb to this sin
any bar within reach, Three sheets to the wind
From a back pedal the backstroke got traded in my life jacket for a mask and cloak
Three sheets to the wind
I had to go, watch the sail grab the rope
See shanty ending on a sad note, three sheets to the wind
Malnutrition (Pull me in)
Bad Religion (Pull me in), Fact or Fiction thats addiction
Three sheets to the wind

[Chorus]

Pick it up, put it down

[Chorus]

Three sheets to the wind
