Song:   Worry Not
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Worry not, keep your stress in check
Anxiety's a disease, you gotta learn to live with it
Cancer spreads, it'll eat right through
There oughta be a quarantine for people like you

I keep clenching my jaw while I sleep
I ain't got no dental insurance, so I purchased a mouth piece
It helps me collect all my teeth, coz they keep falling out in my dreams
Repeating each step till I'm knee deep in sweat
Till you need deeper sleep between sheets who need sex
If you need to eat meat then just feed on the flesh
If your will power's weak seekin' ye shall find death
It'll rent it'll lease it'll own you
You can't teach new tricks to no old fool
I've been banned from the bible
But I stand on my own two
Runnin from something my legs have no clue
Bur nin through every last nerve that I got
This condition is more than deserved but I'm not
Killing the time I'm ringin' it's neck
Chokin it out and I'm stealin' its breath
Sucking it in and then blowing a kiss
To the caution I tossed to the wind like this

[Chorus]
Worry not, keep your stress in check
Anxiety's a disease, you gotta learn to live with it
Cancer spreads, it'll eat right through
There oughta be a quarantine for people like you

Oh you're scared of the dark? then sleep in the light
You came for the bark but then leave when I bite?
Breakin' a sweat
Your faint and awake wit a fang in your neck
And a pain in your chest
Losing your power your drained and your wet
When you threw in the towel I caught it like rent
That was well played - you ain't self made
You went from daycare to preschool from K-12 grade
And that's hardwiring in your brain
Not to mention the rules or the house where you stayed
Synagogue mosque or the church where you prayed
As a child tamed like your wild!
Reprogram - DEPROGRAM
There aint nothin they say we don't know man
They been preyin on vulnerable people
And claimin that everything in us is evil
I see them in hell then - but until then
You should chill friend (Just chill!)
Play pretend with the forces of organized
Superstition and get played in the end
We were killing the time I was ringin' it's neck
Chokin it out and then stealin' its breath
Sucking it in and then blowing a kiss
To the caution I tossed to the wind like this

[Chorus]
