"A healthy distrust"

Chorus: Will Oldham
Force of my love was strong
Sea lion laying down long
A song in the air, why should singer care when
Singer can be among song

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 1: Sage Francis]
Ma, ma, look what I did, ma
Look what I did to my hands, I broke 'em
You gave me the stone, gave me the chisel
Didn't say how to hold 'em
Didn't say give away every piece
Of the puzzle til I was left with nothin'
But I took it upon myself
To crush it up and distribute the dust
Get in the bus
Hop in the van
Jump in the water, crawl to the land
Build another castle out of the sand
Break it down and then I get into the saddle again
Gone city to city, I'm already lost, tell the boss
Who is new in town
I'm a ride this horse til it bucks me off
And I'm forced to shoot it down
I'm a take him out for some gasoline
I'm a trade this cow for some magic beans
Make mom proud of the deals that I've made
Cause I'm just a modern day Johnny Appleseed
But I'm glad that I never passed the gins
And I never, put down the axe (Axe...)
Piano man got a checkered dance floor
To grace, and the painful look on his face
Cause the crowd is packed, and the louder they clapped
The less he is able to make the connection
Between what he sees, when he hears certain notes
And the hurt that is shown in his facial expression
I
Don't need your "go-ahead" to go ahead
Yeah, I know no one said it was gon' be easy
But sweet Jesus, who wants to sleep with me
Way to many moves to learn
But not enough people to put 'em on
Look it, mom, no hands, I built this suit of armor with wooden arms

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Saul Williams]
Oh God, I think I'm dead (Dead)
I can't see outside my head (Head)
Brains and bloods and cryptic gang men
Czars and warlords breaking bread (Bread)
Thoughts are thought, what's said is said (Said)
I thought that 'fore you said it (Said it)
I didn't mean to think out loud
My tongue slipped, but who let it
Let it be
Let me be
Let me go
Now let me out (Me out...)
My manhood nods and whispers
When my father screams and shouts
Dear dad, I'm sad you dead, a new man
Standing in the pulpit (Pulpit...)
He bows before a wooden cross
And forces, praise the culprit
I'm a tenor, in the choir
But I sing a different song (Song...)
Of how the where's and why's of now
All prove I don't belong
But I'm staying
I've planted seeds and planned to watch 'em grow (Watch 'em grow...)
I've watered all my wishes, dreams
Fulfilled, more seeds to sow
And I promised
To learn to love the way I learned to fear
To unknot all the inhibitions tangled in my hair
To let my ego mound my piles around the barber chair
And make a graceful exit
From my vexed and troubled years
I decided
I've been invited to my own resort (Resort...)
When knights couldn't leave their armor neatly piled by the door (Door...)
And every woman, child and man will gather by the shore (Shore...)
And study how sea lions swim in cursive (Swim in cursive...)

Repeat Chorus
