Song:   Conspiracy to Riot
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

They wanna corrupt me. They tried to corrupt me
This ain't no Swan Song. This is for the ugly ducklings of my country
YOU ARE NOT ALONE HERE!
'psst psst; conspiracy to riot'

Peep the game, dummy. You can't keep the reign from me
It's us who put in the over time, they who make the money
Snickering at trickle down economy
We got nickled and dimed? It's more like highway robbery
Drive in the fast lane. Eyes on the gas gauge
Listen to neo-cons cry about black rage
It doesn't stop there
They're the blowhards. They puff out their chest. They're full of hot air
Providing entertainment for the status quo
Then once every 4 years they pander to the black vote
Oh, religion ain't a tool of control?
Then why they pull the God card once they're losing in the polls?
Foolish. I know. We're victims of circumstance
It ain't coincidence we're children of the worker ants
While those in power ain't never owned a pair of dirty pants
But they're quick to kill your health insurance plans
The rich cheat death with their cheap survival
They found more than one way to beat the Bible
Street disciple... my beats are trifle mega
Don't repeat the cycle, just live your life better
I'm gonna defeat my rival. That's why I'm writing this letter
to let em know we ain't givin' up the fight ever

'psst psst; conspiracy to riot'

They wanna corrupt me. They tried to corrupt me
This ain't no Swan Song. This is for the ugly ducklings of my country
YOU ARE NOT ALONE HERE!
'psst psst; conspiracy to riot.'

Oh yeah; I've got a weapon of mass destruction';
Parked in the back and it's a vessel of gas consumption
Rebels of rap production never adapted to nothing
Imagine my laugh whenever ask me for something
Like I ain't gave it my all
You came fashionably late to the headbanger's ball
After the mob scene lost steam,
And after we spilled pig's blood on the prom queen
I've been told with old age comes wisdom,
But I've found with old age comes old age
We're stuck in our old ways like everything was done much better
in some forgotten era. Thumb sucking America
I can't begin to name the ways I'd pin the blame
on an administration acting inhumane
If it's killing season let's start within
When the hunter becomes the hunted they outlaw hunting (ain't that something.)
Confiscate the ammunition!
Cuz there's a wolf in sheep's skin. A pit bull with lipstick
A pig in a blanket. Some lame duck President
privatizing profit and socializing debt
Collapsed credit. Journalists get arrested
Watch the Blackwater operatives go domestic
Oh, that's a problem? Well don't agonize
Smoke 'em if you got 'em. A whole pack of lies
Summer spring and autumn. Now bring the wintertime
I don't protest snow. I shovel it with picket signs

'psst psst; conspiracy to riot'

They wanna corrupt me. They tried to corrupt me
This ain't no Swan Song. This is for the ugly ducklings of my country
YOU ARE NOT ALONE HERE!


We have the right to assembly and it's the duty of the patriot
to protect his country from the government
But when we try it; but when we try it;
But when we try it;
it's CONSPIRACY TO RIOT!

Peace rally with my friends. Conspiracy to riot
When we have no defense. Conspiracy to riot
Rubber bullets to our heads. Conspiracy to riot
Conspiracy to riot. Conspiracy to riot

When we find voter fraud. Conspiracy to riot
When we defy overlords. Conspiracy to riot
When we finally pull the cord. Conspiracy to riot
Conspiracy to riot. Conspiracy to riot

'Til the truth is revealed. Conspiracy to riot
We ain't choosing to kneel. Conspiracy to riot
Let me be the human shield. Conspiracy to riot
Conspiracy to riot. Conspiracy to riot
