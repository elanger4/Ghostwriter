Song:   Needle
Typed by: AZ Lyrics

It's the b-boy, its the MC, they cant read the graffiti
It's the b-boy, it's the MJ, its the VJ they cant read the graffiti on the walls

[Chorus]
Throw away my tools, scrape with my hands make as much noise as I can banging on sand
I used to play in a band but those people are gone
Now the turntable got a needle in it's arm

I'm in a van flying without parachutes
wifey didn't plan to have marriage disputes
Every time I stand at the door to say goodbye
It's like she's watching her man go to die
I packed in a rush but it was too fast for us
handed me an ultimatum as I grabbed all my stuff
Put a pillow in my briefcase I come with no rebates
A guarantee of return when I leave state
I make mix tapes, but they're CD-R's
Diggin in crates, do you see these scars?
They're from big breaks that I stripped from a song
Now the turntable got a needle in its arm

Flame on like burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' but wait...

I fill up the milk crates, collect the LP's
Eric B laughin' at me c-c-check out my melody
DJ Polo doin' pawn, terminator X on an ostrich farm
Jam master J is gone and that's a shame
They say its better to burn out quick than faddddeee
I toured the states with a guy named CR
he had nothin but a tube of toothpaste and guitar
He was a soul brother, a baby mama back at home brother
A good reminder what it is to rock and roll brother
Mashed potatoes every meal
and if it ain't served outa greasy spoon he don't deal
Real as it gets with a puff that don't quit
put him at a piano and he smokes it
A blues man, to old to go back to school man
still grinding it out but he already payed his dues man
I could see it in his face when he said Sage
brother I gotta get out of this place
Embarassed, he knocked me off balance
truth of the matter is you can't live off raw talent
Perhaps you could at one point but those days seem gone
Now the turntable got a needle in its arm
