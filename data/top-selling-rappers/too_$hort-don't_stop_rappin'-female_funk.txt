Short there baby what's that axe
I never saw a girl that could finish that
I said you look so high and your hair so long
When I see you baby I'm gonna sing this song

Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk

I tell you about a freak that I met
Short got heat when the funk got wet
She's the one I won't forget 
Got to get that funk like it ain't no sweat
Like a seven eleven on a non stop street
The first young tender was a true the freak
Cuz the funk won't let quit they don't tell me shit

Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk

The second gender that I had 
Talk about Friday that girl was bad
But young tender and sir too short 
Gotta get that funk everyday at fo  
Cuz a brother like me pay to in out
Funk that jump bitch there's just no way out
Once was yours but now she's mine
But now I get that funk I sing this rhyme

Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk

The dirt young tender that I put
Couldn't understand that torched the but
Big time rapper that's what I am
But in that funk I'm superman
The dirt young tender she's the one
After two whole dates she had me sprung
Working that funk like I know I should
This and sour when I know that funk is good

Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk

The next young tender was the fourth
So much love for sir too short
The fourth young tender that I'll regret
The girl got scared when the funk got wet
Without that funk what's to play
Sleep, and eat, and work all day
Give me that funk and I might just shout
Sir too short just turned you out

Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk

Too s.h.o.r.t. female funk is all I see
Baby and short all night long
Give me that funk and sing that song

Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk

Hey young female there female funk is what I said
Funk, funk, give me some more
You get a lot of funk when your name too short
Give me that funk give me a lot
That funk won't stop give me that funk don't be 
Everywhere I go they sing this song

Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk

I gotta get more gotta get mail 
Told my hoe by the fifth young tail
Call me up on the telephone 
And said sir too short I'm all alone 
I said there's no need to say anymore
Getting real funky is up to too short
The two emcee is who I be 
Working that funk to the video

Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk

Thirty eight twenty four thrity seven
All about tennies all extra thick
Work that funk if you dare
Cuz all my young tenders got funk to spare
Watch your step you just might slip
Sewed up too short on a tender tip
Got to get that funk with that G
When it get's that high just send to me

Funk [scratch] gotta get that funk
Female funk

The next young tender down the line
Is just a fan who loves the rhymes
She saw me rolling so so hot 
Recognized pain in the start
There's no time so the story goes
I rolled that freak like a two hoe
Cuz I'm a vet not a punk
So let too short just rock that funk

Funk [scratch] gotta get that funk
Female funk

Female funk seven day all two times
Smooth the ocean around the clock
Saw too short just watch that cock

Funk [scratch] gotta get that funk
Female funk
