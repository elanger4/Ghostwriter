[Too $hort talkin]
yo, 'sup, 'sup
$hort Dawg is in the house, beyotch
yea, got my orange juice bottle full of gin
and it's all good
ya know, this might be the last album I make y'all
so I figured like this, why should I go out like a sucker
why should I go out like erybody else
I'm goin out just like I came in this motherfucker
straight mackin, bitch
born to mack
always was and always will be, ya know what I'm sayin
and it's like that
but y'all know what though
even though, throughout my entire career
I always spoke my mind about what was goin on with my folks and my community
all I ever got credit for was sayin one motherfuckin word
heh, ya know what I'm sayin
but it's cool though
cuz now you know what's happenin now
you got all these rappers out here
on the mic, on their records, sayin beyotch!
just like $hort Dawg, ya know what I'm sayin
heh, and it's cool like that
I got this youngstaz up in the O-Town
runnin around here, they trynna earn a reputation trynna diss $hort Dawg
not knowin, all through their elementary and high years
all they listen to was Too $hort, ya know what I'm sayin
well like I told you man, I'm goin out like I came in
I'm goin out like a motherfuckin champ
and God knows, I'm known y'all, I'm known for a motherfuckin fact
y'all niggaz can't fuck with me
you never could fuck with me on the real deal, man
I came befo' you, and I'mma finish befo' you
and it's like, it's like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar man
I got the most points scored
and you gotta catch up, ya know what I'm sayin
so it's all good
for the first nigga that step up and take over
it's yours, baby, but for now I'm still runnin this motherfucker, ya know
and you can put a bitch on that one
like that
