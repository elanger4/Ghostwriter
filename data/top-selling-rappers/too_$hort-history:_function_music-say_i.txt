[ CHORUS: Stresmatic ]
All in favor of gettin ripped and gone
And you're gonna have to call someone to drive you home
Say I (I) I-I (I) I-I-I (I) I-I-I (I)
All in favor of gettin super high
And you might start to feel like a bird that can fly
Say I (I) I-I (I) I-I-I (I) I-I-I (I)

[ VERSE 1: E-40 ]
Plug me in and watch me go, bad on a hoe-ass nigga
Don't gimme no mo', I'm on my second fifth of liquor
Once I'm powered up it's hard for me to power down
I fuck a nigga up and put tears on him like a clown
I went from rags to riches, riches to rags
Top convertables, Benzes and Jags
Smokin me herbal, sippin me wine
Or should I say turtle cause it's green and it's lime
Every since he was a infant he was raised around pimpin
When he took his first step he walked with a limp'n
Mannish nigga, hard-headed, damn fool
His teacher sucked his dick in high school
Supercalifragilisticexpialihooligan
Breakin down the diesel mixin cookies with the headband
Went to jail on a Friday, didn't get out until Tuesday
Got a DUI for drinkin too much Louis
Bitch

[ CHORUS: Stresmatic ]

[ VERSE 2: Too $hort ]
I, got a DUI, why? I didn't even have to drive
Now, I'm in jail for a crime
Made bail and I paid the fine
My lawyer charged me high-ass prices
DMV 'bout to take my license
Insurance is goin up
And when I go to court I know I'm fucked
All this shit just for drinking
Need a designated driver, I'm to drunk for thinking
Two hands on the steering wheel
Don't let a friend drink and drive if you're bein real
Might crash the whip, might lose your life
If I get too high tonight
Just make sure I make it home safe and you do the same
Now let's get fucked up and lose it, mane

[ CHORUS: Stresmatic ]

[ VERSE 3: Wiz Khalifa ]
Rollin papers so loud I wake up the neighbors
A boss, I don't need no favors
You pussy, so fuck a hater - bitch
Now that my cake up, my crib got an elevator
My new shoes is alligator
And every meal got a waiter with
It, I'm all about pourin drank up
While I'm rollin the stank up
Sweat my wife out her make-up
Blow a pound when I wake up
See the cars, they don't wanna race us
I do it big, niggas do it A-cup
Walk up in the club, they gon' bring some champagne
I'ma blow a lot of drugs, I put money on it
Spendin all this bank, let a fuck nigga hate
Real niggas show love, sound funny, don't it?
All this money, think I lucked up
All this gin got me fucked up
Man, I live life the Taylor way
Drinkin Bombay and lemonade, rollin up some paper planes

[ CHORUS: Stresmatic ]
