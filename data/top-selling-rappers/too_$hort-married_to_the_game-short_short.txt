Short Short

Short Dog you so cold
Youze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog let 'em know
Still spitting that game
and macking hoes

Short
Short Dog you so cold
Youze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog let 'em know
Still spitting that game
cadillac on ???

[Verse 1]
I heard short dog settled down and tied the knot
you think I'm dreaming
you think I fade 'em all and lied a lot
My real friends know
I always try to find me a woman
but everywhere I go
bitches try to slide me something
now listen up, I try to make it quick
I tell you about my greatest hits
my latest flick, was a porno
cuz I reached that level
I fulfilled all my fantasies
I passed several.. beautiful women
im a thrill seeker, a pro player
my speciality is ex cheerleaders
dancers, gymnasts, and ballerinas
they all hot like some halapenos
if I released the names and pictures
of all the bitches
drop everything you doing
and call the missus
she was young when she met me
so don't hate her
im an entertainer
and a master manipulator

Short Dog let them know [What?]
Just how the game really goes [Its Pimping]
I don't think they know [She know]
The game is still not told [Well tell her]

Short Dog you so cold
Youze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog let 'em know
Still spitting that game
and macking hoes

Short Dog you so cold
Youze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog let 'em know
Still spitting that game
cadillac on ???

[Verse 2]
Now would it make you maad?
Knowing Too Short had
wine and laughs
candle-lit bubble baths
I hit that ass
way before you knew your bitch
shes kinda fast
I still wanna do your bitch
take a chance, sit down and have a seat
you know the saying 'dont bring your girl round me'
did you think my greatest hits was gonna be some songs?
Nope, just some stories about a bunch of thongs
fo sho
shes the type that you haad to marry
you walked in the room and said Halle Berry
Thats what she looked like
so I put my thing up in her, rolled over and said good night
when I woke up in the morning, she looked the same
so I did the same thing to her, hooked her mayn
I hit her two best friends first
thats what I did
she heard I was good in bed
thats what they said

Short Dog let them know [What?]
Just how the game really goes [They Know]
I don't think they know [They better]
The game is still not told [its game baby]

Short Dog you so cold
Youze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog let 'em know
Still spitting that game
and macking hoes

Short Dog you so cold
Youze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog let 'em know
Still spitting that game
cadillac on ???

[Verse 3]
From 14-41, 4'11-6 feet
Lil mama was a big freak
The 6 footer had her time with me
I got some supermodel head on miami beach
Then I fingerfucked the woman on the plane next to me
when it landed, the flight attendant had sex with me
and they ask 'is it the pimp in you?'
I hit reporters morning after interviews
checking in, lil cutie at the front desk
all in my face, lookin like she wants this
later on, she asks me to play her a song
getting nasty in my room with her uniform on
I been with roommates, sisters, EVEN twins
next door neighbours ??? and best friends
I got passed around the crew, WILLINGLY
until this very day they all feeling me

Short Dog let them know [Know what?]
Just how the game really goes [Tell them]
I don't think they know [They know]
The game is still not told [beeeeeeyatch]

Short Dog you so cold
Youze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog let 'em know
Still spitting that game
and macking hoes

Short Dog you so cold
Youze a player from coast to coast
Short Dog let 'em know
Still spitting that game
cadillac on ???
