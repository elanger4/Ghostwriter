[Chorus]
You're thuggin and you love the streets
huggin the block, sellin rocks, gettin major heat
and niggaz hatin, and you aint stop to think about
niggaz runnin they mouth, niggaz cessed you out
That's how it goes down
What happened to the days when we could hug a block
flippin rocks and just get money
I remember when you and me used to ball, we had it all, and we took a fall

[Verse One]
I came up in Cokeland, better known as Oakland
Your weed could sell, are you smokin?
Eighteen with a big Mercedes
Sellin dope in the mid-eighties
Homie talkin bout I'm about to win
now when you gon' let'em all out the pen
You sold crack to hell and back
whoever would have thought you could fail at that
Bein broke aint never been cool 
and it aint no hope when youre failing in school
You might as well flip the sac
roll out of town and take a trip with that
Or you could just hit the block
stayin on the corner, come and get the rocks
Bein out on the streets as a young teen
wasn't always a fun thing

[Chorus]
You're thuggin and you love the streets
huggin the block, sellin rocks, gettin major heat
and niggaz hatin, and you aint stop to think about
niggaz runnin they mouh, niggaz snitched you out
That's how it goes down
What happened to the days when we could hug a block
flippin rocks and just get money
I remember when you and me used to ball
we had it all, and we took a fall
That's how it goes down

[Verse Two]
Dope fiend still get high
while dope dealers barely get by
You better get your life right
you wanna live in the 'burbs with your white wife
Do your own thing
I know you want change
and I can't play you wrong man
I'm laced with that long game
It's just not a lot of choices man
you aint plannin to go to jail with the poison clan
So you could be another number in the system, stuck, for years
got a brother in the pen fucked up
All the stashes you know you kept
and everything that the police left
It's too late when you notice it
it's all gone, motherfuckers done stole yo shit
You wanna kill'em and you still do
but realize that real killas get killed too

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
He's dissappeared into thin air, he's nowhere
whens the last time he been here, we don't care
Cause he don't come around no mo'
nigga live with his momma, down in brough
He's just tryin to survive
I guess it's all right cause at least he's alive
cause nowadays a lil kid might shoot you down
Life's wild in the town
young fools like to clown
He did the same thing, fall for the lies
hold your head up high and swallowed the pride
Caught in a trap, but don't know what you in
had a million, now you ain't got two cents
You can't say nothin, now what
I don't hear you talkin all that loud stuff
If you live and you die by the game and you lose
at least you did spend your life tryin to change

[Chorus]

That's how it goes down
That's how it goes down
That's how it goes down

[Singing]
I remember when we had it all...(we had it all)
and I remember when we used to ball...(we used to ball)
I remember, don't you remember
when we had it all, we used to ball

That's how it goes down
That's how it goes down
That's how it goes down
