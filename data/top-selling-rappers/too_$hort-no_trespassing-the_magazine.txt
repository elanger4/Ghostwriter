[Intro/Chorus: Chase Hattan]
You only see her in magazines
Look at shorty she follow the dreams
But you can only see her in the magazines
And I hit that all the time

[Too $hort]
You in love with her, you wanna marry her
Make lots of love and have kids for her
But she's a bad girl, you cain't get with her
Then she go to her job and you tippin her
You fantasize about a lot of things
But the truth is, that's not your dream
That's hers! And that's all she wants
Can't tell nobody so she gots to front
We all got to have a dream
Starin at things in the magazines
Life ain't bad, but it always seems
I never wanna talk when you callin me
We have sex but we never kiss
What you gon' do with that wedding dress?
I saw you on stage, you the finest thing
But I still cain't buy that diamond ring

[Chorus]

[Too $hort]
You fell in love young and got married
To some of these girls that's scary
Stay home, you can't go out now
Stuck in the house on lock-down
Just can't go on like this
Cause all you get is boring sex
Keep watching them porno tapes
You want it but you cain't go on no dates
So you stare at the magazines
Dreamin, wishin you could have those things
But all you do is cook and clean
Feels like somebody just took yo' dreams
And your husband said it
It won't happen, forget it
You laughing but it ain't so funny
Because you know, you coulda been a Playboy Bunny

[New Chorus]
You only see her in magazines
Look at Shorty she follow the dreams
Coulda been a Playboy, coulda been a Playboy Bunny
And I hit that all the time

[Too $hort]
It feels good when you clap to the music
Cain't dance? All you got to do is two-step
Listen to 'em play that acoustic
We 'bout to do this~!
You wish and you dream and hope to get things
You want 'em, but know it's just dreams
Wake up and don't know what it means
(Coulda been a Playboy bunny!)
We all gotta have a dream
Starin at things in the magazines
Dreamin, wishin you could have those things

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Coulda been a Playboy bunny)
Look at Shorty she follow the dreams
(Coulda been a Playboy bunny)
But you can only see her in the magazine
And I hit that all the time
(Coulda been a Playboy bunny)
